Optimism or Overconfidence?

</h1>


	<div class="entry-content"><p>I recently moved to Seattle with no job or contract lined up. We had a little bit of a financial cushion (at the time we arrived in Seattle, about 2 months expenses, plus a little), and that was about it.</p>

<p>About 3 weeks in, I decided to call into <a href="http://twitter.com/danbenjamin">Dan Benjamin</a> / <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5</a>&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://5by5.tv/quit">QUIT!</a> podcast. This is run as a combination interview (usually there is at least one guest in the studio or on the line) and call in show. I had <em>planned</em> to call in and explain my situation, and to talk about how I wasn&#8217;t really concerned: I was fairly confident I would find something.</p>

<p>Dan was pretty concerned.</p>

<p>And not without cause; by the time I called, I&#8217;ve been in Seattle for nearly a month, looking constantly, still not working, and only a little more than the next month&#8217;s expenses covered. Also, I&#8217;m 39 (does this matter? I&#8217;m still not sure) and solely supporting my wife and son. Also, we&#8217;re living in the middle of Seattle, and for better or worse, the house we picked has a moderately high rent. In other words, just going and getting a job at a fast food place to make ends meet isn&#8217;t going to cut it; nothing to do with pride, but a whole months wages at McDonald&#8217;s is not even going to cover my rent. Poor planning? Maybe. Would I do this again? Probably not.</p>

<p>Since then, I found first some short term Ruby on Rails work, followed by a 6-month contract. So, in a sense, my &#8220;confidence&#8221; that I would land on my feet should be totally vindicated: I was &#8220;right&#8221;. We&#8217;re fine.</p>

<p>After talking to Dan, and even after landing this contract, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time asking myself <em>why</em> I was so confident that it would work out. I didn&#8217;t really think twice about the &#8220;work&#8221; aspect of it as we were preparing to leave. I mean, I was working hard at finding something: I was calling everyone, following up with everyone, doing phone interviews, studying for technical interviews, looking into marketing for building a pipeline if I were to stay a consultant, all of these things. But I never <em>really</em> considered the possibility that the money would run out before I started working.</p>

<p>Well: what if it had? It would have been rough. We could have eked out another month of expenses on credit. In a worst case, family <em>might</em> have been able to help us with some money, but I&#8217;m not very comfortable asking for that, and it would have been a last resort; just a way to cover rent and get some food if our credit was totally exhausted. To be honest, I probably would have taken money out of our retirement savings before asking family for help, because, I don&#8217;t know, that&#8217;s just me.</p>

<p>What then? Well, presumably, I would have found <em>something</em> in that extra couple months that all that credit and retirement withdrawal would buy us. What if I hadn&#8217;t?</p>

<p>Good question.</p>

<p>As it happens, I <em>did</em> find something. So I&#8217;m still asking myself: why was I so sure? It&#8217;s tempting to phrase it &#8220;how did I <em>know</em> I would find something?&#8221;, but of course, I didn&#8217;t <em>know</em>&mdash;I was just <em>fairly certain it would work out</em>.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Maybe because it had always worked out in the past? That&#8217;s possible. I&#8217;ve been doing freelance/contract work for nearly 5 years, and sure enough it <em>has</em> always worked out in the past. But as the SEC loves to remind us, <em>past performance is no guarantee of future results</em>, so maybe that isn&#8217;t the best reason.</p>

<p>One thing that came up on that first call was the idea of risk. Marco (Arment), a guest on that episode, remarked that he had always been far too risk-averse to attempt to cut anything that close.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, you asked me if I were risk-averse, I would probably say yes. What in the world was wrong with me that I didn&#8217;t consider this action as <em>risky</em> as, well, pretty much everyone else did?</p>

<p>I look back to my first contract. I was working at what Dan likes to call a &#8220;corporate stooge&#8221; job for Oracle. (Actually, my team and my manager were phenomenal, but yes, it was tech support, and I had reached the point where I <em>really</em> didn&#8217;t enjoy what I was doing; so I think it fits). I left that fairly &#8220;secure&#8221;, (FWIW: there were layoffs in Oracle that affected our department about a year later), fairly prestigious (Oracle is a big deal!) role for a <em>three month contract</em>. Three months! That&#8217;s not very long. What was I thinking?</p>

<p>That first contract was for <a href="http://twitter.com/jondahl">Jon Dahl</a> (who is now more well known for co-founding <a href="http://zencoder.com">Zencoder</a>). I remember asking him about that: &#8220;3 months. I really want to take this&#8221;, I think I may have said; &#8220;but 3 months isn&#8217;t a long time. What will I do after three months?&#8221;</p>

<p>He replied along the lines of, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s lots of work out there. You&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, I jumped, and Jon&#8217;s advice is something I took to heart. The work is out there, I always thought, and I&#8217;ll be fine. And I was. There were a few rough spots due to poor planning on my part (just because the work is out there doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t need to work at finding it), but we made it through.</p>

<p>So, when it came time to move to Seattle, and I was between contracts, rather than think <em>this is a terrible time to move, I&#8217;m between contracts</em>, I thought, <em>this is the ideal time to move, I&#8217;m between contracts</em>.</p>

<p>Could it have gone horribly, horribly wrong? Well, yeah. It <em>could</em> have. It turns out that it <em>didn&#8217;t</em>, but there&#8217;s no way I could know that.</p>

<p>To make it even <em>worse</em>, the contact that I&#8217;m about to start&mdash;the one that is, in a sense, literally saving our bacon&mdash;did not come from doing any of the right things.</p>

<h2>How to find a new contract without really trying</h2>

<p>The real way I wound up in this particular contract was by screwing up. I had an interview lined up at a certain local company, and I had been referred to that company some months earlier via a mailing list post, by an employee there. So, I thought that I&#8217;d just get a little more prepared by asking if he had any thoughts/tips for the interview. Of course, he couldn&#8217;t say all that much, just offered some encouragement.</p>

<p><strong>But</strong>, when I emailed him to ask for said advice, I was replying to that post on the local Ruby mailing list. From my phone. I hit &#8220;send&#8221; on the email without <em>really</em> checking the &#8220;to&#8221; address. Some readers have already guessed what I did: yep, I sent my little request for interview advice to the whole freaking mailing list.</p>

<p>Ouch. There was nothing in the content of the email that embarrassed me, but just the simple fact of <em>accidentally</em> replying to the whole list; well, <em>that</em> was embarrassing. Oops. Oh well.</p>

<p>Funny thing, though: because that went out to the whole list, I got a couple replies from other people who were looking to hire Ruby developers. Replies that I <em>never</em> would have seen otherwise. Opportunities that arose for no other reason than that I was asleep at the switch while writing an email, and I screwed up.</p>

<p>Huh.</p>

<p>All that hustling, and I wind up landing a role simply because of a dumb mistake.</p>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

<p>I have no idea. Should you move to a new city with no job and only a couple months worth of savings? Probably not. Should you trust that if you&#8217;re working hard at the right things, even your screw ups will turn to your benefit? Ah, probably not, again. Would I do this again? I don&#8217;t think so. But now that I&#8217;ve done it, with the advantage of hindsight, I&#8217;m very glad I did.</p>

<p>Was I really unwise to <em>assume</em> that everything would work out?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still not sure.</p>
