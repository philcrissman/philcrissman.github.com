    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/seattlehouse.jpg" title="zomg a house" alt="The new house. Don't be creepy" /></p>

<p>We&#8217;ve just moved to Seattle. Although I&#8217;ve already done moves from British Columbia (my home town, Surrey) to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and then from Tulsa to Minneapolis, Minnesota, this is definitely the hugest move I&#8217;ve ever done. When I moved from BC to Tulsa, I was living in a furnished single room that I rented from a family; so I left all my boxes behind and moved with a single suitcase and a duffle bag. Or something like that. When I moved up to Minneapolis, I had been in Tulsa for a few years, but I still moved with a minimum of &#8220;stuff&#8221;: everything fit into the Nissan Sentra that I was driving at the time.</p>

<p><em>This</em> move, Amy and I have been married for 11+ years, have a 2 year old, and all kinds of stuff. What started as a plan to use a single 16&#8217; PODS container morphed into me renting a 26&#8217; UHaul, packing it to the gills, and then driving that 1700 miles towing a Mazda CX-9 on a trailer. Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;ve decided to rule out &#8220;long distance truck driver&#8221; from my list of prospective mid-life crisis career changes.</p>

<p>That said, everything has gone pretty well. Made the drive in about 2 1/2 days. The folks at UHaul on MLK way were simply <em>awesome</em>, allowing me to park the (full) UHaul in their lot until I was able to actually move into the new house, giving me some additional small discounts, and just generally being an absolute pleasure to work with. They&#8217;re getting a Christmas card this year. We had a friend of a friend of a friend find some guys who were willing and able to help unload the UHaul on a weekday, even knowing ahead of time that we had a piano (we have a piano).</p>

<p>Everything is still a little chaotic, but it&#8217;s coming together. Looking forward to going to http://seattlerb.org tomorrow, if I can.</p>

    <id>http://philcrissman.com/2013/01/08/a-year-from-now</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A recurring realization throughout my childhood was looking back at the things I had done or said or been interested in the year or years prior, and cringing to myself; being alternatively amused, ashamed, or dismayed by the sort of things I had thought or done. At nine, I thought 8-year old me was a bit of a doofus. At 10, I realized that 9-year old me was still a bit goofy. At 13, I figured out that pre-teen me was not very cool. At 15, I thought 13-year old me was a bit of a sycophant (disclosure: I don&#8217;t think I actually knew the word &#8220;sycophant&#8221; when I was 15). In my 20s, I thought teenage-me was totally clueless. By my late 20s, I saw that that period of cluelessness should be expanded to include my early 20s.</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>Through today. Even looking back a few years ago, I&#8217;m bemused by things I may have thought or said, or dismayed by thoughts of how I could have handled given situations in a better way.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s hardest to realize is that, a year or two from now, I&#8217;ll look back at me <em>today</em> and see all (a lot of) the ways in which I&#8217;m currently being an idiot.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>Eric Barker talks a bit about it <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2013/01/person-expect-be/">here</a>, which is what reminded me about this. But this is something I think about periodically, which hopefully prevents me from believing that I&#8217;ve become too smart: in a year, or a little more, I&#8217;ll realize all too well just how smart I&#8217;m <em>not</em> right now.</p>

    <id>http://philcrissman.com/2012/11/28/alternate-fizzbuzz-solution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with what &#8216;FizzBuzz&#8217; refers to, see <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: So here is a description of the &#8216;FizzBuzz&#8217; problem. Do you think you could give us a quick solution for this?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Sure, that looks pretty simple. I can solve it any way I like?</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Of course.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Great. Well, I&#8217;ll start by writing a unit test.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: &#8230; Well, that probably isn&#8217;t necessary&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Maybe not, but I want to be able to instantly verify the solution. Let&#8217;s see. Well, to test the output, I&#8217;ll need a reference string. <em>[Begins writing]</em> Something to compare the output to show that it&#8217;s correct&#8230; So, like, &#8220;1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz&#8230;&#8221; <em>[Continues writing]</em></p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Well&#8230; Okay&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Does this look right? <em>[Displays finished string of numbers 1..100 with Fizz &amp; Buzz appropriately inserted]</em> As in, if our output matches this, we&#8217;ll have a successful program?</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Sure, that looks correct, but&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Great. Now let&#8217;s write our function. Here&#8217;s our method; we&#8217;d run the test here and watch it fail. Now, just to make it green, I&#8217;ll just have the method output our reference string.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: &#8230;</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Say, this actually fulfills the requirements right now. I guess I&#8217;m done.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: But you actually haven&#8217;t written anything to programmatically produce the FizzBuzz string!</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: True, but since we already have a string which we&#8217;ve agreed is the correct result, if we just output that string, we&#8217;ll satisfy the requirements for the problem. So, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re done.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: But what if we wanted to see the results from 1 to 10,000?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Well, gee. <em>That</em> wasn&#8217;t in the requirements.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruby is a powerful language, but how much power does it have if you remove all of its datatypes except for Proc and all of its features except for Proc.new and Proc#call?

<p>I think I&#8217;d agree with this, but with reservations. For starters, I think many of the developers I know are better than average writers. Maybe I&#8217;m in an anomolous community, but that&#8217;s my impression. Second, just because someone <em>can</em> write well, doesn&#8217;t mean they will write any documentation, let alone <em>good</em> documentation. It&#8217;s food for thought, though.</p>

    <link href="http://philcrissman.com/2012/10/19/sometimes-you-need-to-ignore-your-mind/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-19T15:39:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://philcrissman.com/2012/10/19/sometimes-you-need-to-ignore-your-mind</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/45lb_plate.jpg" title="45 lbs" alt="45 lbs" /></p>

<p>Some time ago, if you had told me that overcoming my mind would be a big factor in working out a the gym, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have agreed. Oh, I may have <em>assented</em>, but, you know; really? My mind? Other than just getting myself out of bed and <em>into</em> the gym, I wouldn&#8217;t have seen how it mattered.</p>

<p>I realized the other day how much it does matter.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m doing a fairly straightforward workout regimen at the moment; for most exercises, I simply add 5 lbs each session (until stalling, of course, at which point I&#8217;ll stick to that weight until I can meet my target reps). This morning, adding 5 lbs to my bench press lift meant going to 135 lbs.</p>

<p>About 5 days ago, I benched with 130 lbs, and did all my sets to all my reps. So, what: 5 extra pounds? Doesn&#8217;t seem like a big deal.</p>

<p>Except that, when you move to 135 lbs on a barbell, you move to putting one single 45 lb plate on each side (the bar itself is 45 lbs). For some reason, when there were several smaller plates on each side, my mind could look at the barbell and think, <em>sure. I can lift that.</em></p>

<p>But with one, large, 45 lb plate (the largest plate you find in any barbell system), my brain thought: <em>2 45lb plates, plus the barbell? That looks heavy. I don&#8217;t know if I can lift that. In fact, I bet I can&#8217;t.</em></p>

<p>Mind.</p>

<p>I had to literally ignore the plates, and just look at the bit of barbell above my head and tell myself, this is just 5lbs more than I lifted a few days ago. A few days ago, I had no trouble. This will be no trouble, either.</p>

<p>5 sets later, all reps complete, it was actually no trouble at all.</p>

<p>Now, you may be thinking that 135lbs isn&#8217;t a very heavy bench. You may be right. Except that I haven&#8217;t been working out, seriously, for all that long, and bench has not traditionally been an exercise I&#8217;ve been strong in. As far as I was concerned, the barbell with a 45 lb plate on each side was a milestone. I may have lifted it before, but not for several sets, each set meeting my target reps. So it isn&#8217;t about how much I can bench at this point, but that my mind, for <em>no rational reason other than the large plates <strong>looked</strong> heavier</em>, was trying to tell me I couldn&#8217;t lift it.</p>

<p>Point being not how much my bench press is or isn&#8217;t. I finally see how big a part your brain plays, even in pursuits that you might normally think of as 100% physical. I can see how this could apply to a lot of things. Can I bike for 10 miles? Sure, I can do that. How about 20? Sure. 30? 50? 100? Now, if I were to try to go straight from biking 10 miles to 100, nope: probably not. My brain will balk and truthfully, my brain might be correct. But if I were I work my way up to that&#8230; If I could bike 30 miles, could I do 50? If I could do 50, how about 75? I think you still need to proceed in reasonable steps. Partly because yeah, you actually <em>do</em> need to work your body up to these things. I couldn&#8217;t come back next week and bench 300lbs just by thinking &#8220;I can do it!&#8221; But also to give yourself ammunition to overcome your brain&#8217;s objections, so that when you think you can&#8217;t, you can reasonably argue with yourself that you can.</p>

<p>There are going to be times when the truth is, you <em>can</em> do [whatever], but you&#8217;re brain is telling you that you <em>can&#8217;t</em>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s when you need to ignore your brain.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Punk Rock]]></title>
    <link href="http://philcrissman.com/2012/10/16/punk-rock/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-16T08:35:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://philcrissman.com/2012/10/16/punk-rock</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/usedtobepunkrock.jpg" title="I used to be punk rock" alt="I used to be punk rock" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I ever was punk rock. On the other hand, I&#8217;m not sure I ever stopped.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s complicated. It probably depends who you ask.</p>

<p>For me, the entire idea of punk rock isn&#8217;t about the aesthetic, though there was a time when I sort of &#8220;fit&#8221; that mold (viz, &#8220;We all wear a uniform&#8221;, Frank Zappa). It isn&#8217;t about the politics. It isn&#8217;t even (completely) about the music, as I <em>love</em> a lot of music that the original punk rock movement sort of rose up as a reaction against (John Lydon/Johnny Rotten was infamously reported to be discovered by Malcolm McLaren wearing a homemade <em>I hate Pink Floyd</em> t-shirt), though I do love a lot of punk rock music. What I really love about punk rock music is the backbone of integrity that it aspires to&mdash;at least, in my mind. A lot of people, among them folks who are &#8220;really&#8221; punk rock, might not see it the same way.</p>

<p>I think of it as distilling the entire notion of why I do what I do; why you do what you do, why anyone does what they do. In my mind, the motivation implicit in a &#8220;punk rock&#8221; mentality is that, I&#8217;m really not doing this for you. If you like it, that&#8217;s great, and we can have this bond over this shared like of this thing that we&#8217;re doing, but I didn&#8217;t do it so you would like it. That oversimplifies, because sure, if you&#8217;re producing things, whomever you see as &#8220;your people&#8221;, yes, <em>of course</em> you hope that they like it. At least, I do. But at the same time, if you let other people&#8217;s opinions be the sole barometer of the value of your work, I think you wind up with some blank, insipid creation that takes no risks and says nothing, and yeah, no one will like it anyways. Better to do something that at least <em>you</em> like, and then if only a handful of other people like it, at least it&#8217;s genuine.</p>

<p>This makes me think of the whole idea of &#8220;selling out&#8221;. Talking about this is a sure-fire way to stir people up. For some folks, simply &#8220;being successful&#8221; is synonymous with &#8220;selling out&#8221;, which I think is (rightfully) seen as a pretty silly stance by most people. In my mind, it has more to do with <em>what were you willing to change in order to be successful</em>? Is this dumb, old fashioned? Don&#8217;t we want success, at any cost? I don&#8217;t know, but I think most people would say &#8220;no&#8221;.</p>

<p>At the other extreme, I think some people think that there is no such thing as &#8220;selling out&#8221;: no one should ever have their success criticized or impinged with accusations of lost integrity or compromised principles. It&#8217;s none of our business, some would say. I can see that, in most cases, but I don&#8217;t totally buy that, either. I&#8217;m not going to bring up examples, because I don&#8217;t want to derail the discussion into a debate or who really <em>did</em> or <em>did not</em> &#8220;sell out&#8221;&mdash;but I can certainly think of bands who I stopped listening to, not because they became popular, but because the things they changed about their music on the way to becoming popular so completely altered their music as to make them into a completely different band; not the same band I had originally loved. It&#8217;s not really just about &#8220;bands&#8221;, though; anything can have integrity, and anything that has integrity can also lose it.</p>

<p>The idea of punk rock as an analogy to <em>integrity</em> might not be a usual association for most people, but it&#8217;s incredibly valid to me. To me, the whole emotional impact of the phrase &#8220;I used to be punk rock&#8221; isn&#8217;t &#8220;I used to have a mohawk and a safety pin in my ear, but now I don&#8217;t&#8221;&mdash;it more says, &#8220;I used to have integrity, but now I don&#8217;t&#8221;. I realize this is a somewhat revisionist interpretation of &#8220;punk rock&#8221;. One could just as easily say that &#8220;punk rock&#8221; ought to be associated with ideas of nihilism, anarchy, apathy, or rebellion. But ultimately, those aren&#8217;t the things that I associate with &#8216;being punk rock&#8217;.</p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/cerebus-high-society-wallpaper.jpg" title="Cerebus -- High Society" alt="High Society" /></p>

<p>I think I mentioned already that I&#8217;ve been rereading Cerebus comics. The first time I read them, I never did get my hands on &#8221;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0919359078/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=idepermin-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0919359078&amp;adid=01FA6RVVXWRQRRTR8DQV&amp;">High Society</a>&#8221; or &#8221;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0919359094/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=idepermin-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0919359094&amp;adid=1NEE9ZRHV08T9JNTKZXE&amp;">Church and State</a>&#8221;; I had read the first volume out of a library, and then started with &#8220;Jaka&#8217;s Story&#8221; through &#8220;Melmoth&#8221; and most of the &#8220;Mothers &amp; Daughters&#8221; story line. Then I fell off the bus for a bit. I&#8217;ve now caught up to about issue 226 (part way through &#8220;Rick&#8217;s Story&#8221;). So, I&#8217;m well past &#8220;re-reading&#8221; and have moved on to just &#8220;reading&#8221;. Looking forward to the conclusion (the entire run of Cerebus is 300 issues, an amazing accomplishment by a single creative team).</p>

<p>Sim&#8217;s a fantastic artist, as is his co-conspirator Gerhard, and a great story-teller, both visually and simply in prose (there&#8217;s a lot of straight prose in certain parts of Cerebus). Well worth a read.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I saw this a week or two ago, and never even thought about posting it. But it&#8217;s really relevant to everything else I&#8217;ve been thinking and writing about, so I thought I&#8217;d add it here.</p>

    <id>http://philcrissman.com/2012/10/09/grit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The topic of &#8220;grit&#8221; is the focus of most of the most recent (<a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/87">#87</a>) back to work. I&#8217;ve thought along these lines a lot. Like Merlin says a couple times, I feel like if I&#8217;m honest, I&#8217;m lacking in grit. Lack of grit has been an issue in accomplishing (or rather, not accomplishing) a lot of things I&#8217;d <em>like</em> to have done.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something Merlin said in an early B2W episode that foreshadows this<a href="#one">1</a>, something said in the character of &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Merlin&#8221;-guy, along the lines of, &#8220;You know, I just can&#8217;t do these things, because I&#8217;m, like, <em>not smart</em> and, like, <em>don&#8217;t try</em>.&#8221; The &#8220;don&#8217;t try&#8221; line is the one I&#8217;m thinking of here.</p>

<blockquote><p><a name="one">1</a> <em>This blog is not intended to be an exercise in &#8220;let&#8217;s comment exclusively on things Merlin and Dan have said in the the Back to Work podcast.&#8221; It just happens that this is maybe the podcast that I listen (and relisten) to the most, and it makes me think about things, and then I want to write about said things. If it comes across as just too sycophantic or something, well, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s anything I can help you with, maybe you should read something else.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Can &#8220;grit&#8221; be developed? I want to believe it can, otherwise I&#8217;d have to resign myself to failure on a lot of areas.</p>

<p>What is &#8220;grit&#8221;? Definitions that came up were along the lines of: Self-restraint, being able to delay gratification. Stick-to-it-iveness.
<span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Very little I&#8217;ve accomplished has been because of &#8220;grit&#8221;.'>
I&#8217;ve accomplished a lot of things by being fortunate, or blessed, or just in the right place at the right time. Very little I&#8217;ve accomplished has been because of &#8220;grit&#8221;.  At least, that&#8217;s how I feel when I look back.
</span></p>

<p>Now, since I just admitted I don&#8217;t have this &#8220;grit&#8221;, here&#8217;s some completely unqualified thoughts on what I imagine <em>might</em> be a way to develop &#8220;grit&#8221;:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Narrow it down. You are just not going to be able to have a single minded dedication to all the dreams you could ever have. If you think you want to write a novel, go to law school after work, learn to program computers from scratch, learn to draw, work out and look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and become president, well, you might need to just pick one of those and go for it. Or at least, one at a time. Someone is already reading this and mentally composing a response about how they can and will achieve all their dreams all at once. Which is great, but&#8230; For most of us, if we actually want to accomplish something, we should probably dial it down. I&#8217;m not saying &#8220;don&#8217;t havebig goals&#8221;&mdash;just, maybe, don&#8217;t have <em>20</em> big goals. Pick one. The hardest part, I think, is deciding what you really care about.</p></li>
<li><p>A blueprint. Figure out the plan. The whole plan. If you really want to write a novel, figure out how to do that. Sure, maybe read about it, that&#8217;s important, but don&#8217;t read about it so much that you never actually start doing it. Figure out who what where when how, figure out how many words a day you would need to write, or how many words you <em>can</em> write, and make a plan when each day you&#8217;ll do that. Then do that the first day. Then the second day.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='This is the step where you simply keep at it, and it feels like a catch-22, like the way to have grit is just to _have grit_'>
3. ??? Around here&#8230; I don&#8217;t know this step. If I did, I guess I would be someone who already <em>has</em> grit. This is the step where you simply keep at it, and it feels like a catch-22, like the way to have grit is just to <em>have grit</em>, which sounds a little motivational speaky, but is also sort of true (at least in the sense that its a tautology). But what if my problem is, I don&#8217;t stick with things? How do I say, <em>this</em> is the thing that I stick with? You could focus on the goal, the finish line. That sounds like a thing that people say, people who talk about these things. But so, how do you <em>do</em> that?
</span></p>

<p>One thought could be, just continue to focus on your goal, on the &#8220;end&#8221; you want to arrive at. If you continue to focus on your &#8220;goal/end&#8221; (eg I want to have finished a novel) and if that vision is still not enough to get you to write a thousand or 500 or even 100 words a day, well, maybe you don&#8217;t really want to do this thing <em>that</em> badly. Sorry. Maybe you need to find a new thing.</p>

<p>See since we&#8217;re talking about novels (which I do actually want to write, and I&#8217;m beginning to think that maybe I actually don&#8217;t care about it enough to ever do it) I&#8217;m reminded of some advice I read in a writing book, I think it was by Lawrence Block. He said you should take a novel that you like, and dissect it. Use a series of colored pencils and highlight the entire book. Mark with one color where a new character is introduced, or where a goal or a conflict or (etc) happens, until you have dissected the structure/framework if the whole novel. Then just plain copy it. As if you we&#8217;re plugging in your characters for theirs, your story goals for theirs, your settings for theirs, and just write it. His point was, if you do this, it will be this sort of derivative copy novel that sort of sucks, but it <em>will</em> be a novel, with characters and a story and a beginning middle and end (because you straight out copied an existing work that had all these things), and you will have <em>finished</em> it, it will exist. Basically, write one to throw away. So, yeah, it will almost definitely be a bad novel and you won&#8217;t ever want to show it to anyone. But you will have done it, and you&#8217;ll have learned a lot about how a novel works and is structured and how it gets from point a to the conclusion.</p>

<p>Now here&#8217;s the thing: if you&#8217;re like me, you might have just read that, and think it makes sense and would work and you <em>still</em> think that you&#8217;re special and you can skip this step and just write your real novel. And if you&#8217;re like me, you still haven&#8217;t ever done it.</p>

<p>It takes grit to write an entire novel that you know will suck and no one will ever read or publish. But what if <em>doing</em> that meant that next, you really <em>could</em> write that real novel that you actually want to write?</p>

<p>Grit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying that the above strategy would work, though it probably wouldn&#8217;t hurt and is probably better than never writing anything, but it&#8217;s something to think about: the idea that if you aren&#8217;t willing to pay the price to reach your goal, well, maybe you just don&#8217;t care enough about that goal. Maybe you need a new goal. Selah.</p>

<p>What is the thing that, thinking about it as though it were really possible, as though it were real, could motivate you to take the steps to make it real?</p>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;ve spilled over into Tony Robbins territory, but think about it anyways. What is it that you care enough about to pay the price to make it happen? And if you don&#8217;t care about anything that much, what would that thing be if you <em>could</em>, and is there any way you could <em>make</em> yourself care that much about it?</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t care that much about the think that you think you want to be your goal, try to imagine what it would feel like to care that much. Picture how you would feel if you were that sort of person. Again, more hippie motivational stuff. Throw it away if it sounds dumb to you. But you never know. It could help.</p>
