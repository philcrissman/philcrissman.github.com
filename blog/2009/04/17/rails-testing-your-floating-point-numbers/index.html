<p>You&#8217;re being a Good Software developer and diligently testing all your code, and lo and behold, you get this result to one of your tests:</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
1) Failure: ... &lt;1.0&gt; expected but was &lt;1.0&gt;
</code>
</pre>


<p>An annoying problem with floats that might look and for all practical purposes be equal, but internally as stored by the computer are not <em>precisely</em> equal.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re probably using:</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
assert_equal 1.0, a_value_expected_to_be_1.0
</code>
</pre>


<p>Instead, use:</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
assert_in_delta 1.0, a_value_expected_to_be_1.0, 0.000001
</code>
</pre>


<p>Though, you may also want to ask yourself if you really need to be using floating point numbers; but assuming that you <em>do</em> need them, <code>assert_in_delta</code> will compensate for the annoying fact that floating point numbers might not actually be precisely what you expect them to be.</p>
