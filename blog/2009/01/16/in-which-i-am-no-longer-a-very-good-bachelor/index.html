<p>My wife has gone to Thailand for two weeks. So I&#8217;m on my own.</p>

<p>I am, as they say, &#8220;batching it&#8221; for a couple weeks. This is usually understood to mean that I will wear the same underwear for two weeks, eat nothing but junk food, abandon cleaning the house, and play video games all night.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t working out so well.</p>

<p>The video game thing isn&#8217;t happening. I look at my X-box (old one, not a 360) and think, <em>I could sit and play something for&#8230; for, well for hours.</em> But then I think, <em>But I&#8217;ve finished all the games I own. And I don&#8217;t really feel like replaying them yet, and I could go get a new used game, but I can&#8217;t think of anything I&#8217;d want to own, and really, is that responsible?</em></p>

<p>I tried to leave the dishes in the sink. Normally this is no problem. This week I keep looking at them and thinking, <em>Sheesh, it&#8217;s only going to take five more seconds to put it in the dishwasher.</em> And the next thing I know, it&#8217;s in the dishwasher.</p>

<p>I bought a huge bag of potato chips when I went grocery shopping. They are still sitting unopened on the kitchen table. Every time I look at them, I think, <em>Those sound good, but I should really eat some real food. Those aren&#8217;t very good for me.</em></p>

<p>I have a strange compulsion to vacuum the rug. I can&#8217;t explain it, it&#8217;s just there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried leaving my clothes on the floor when I change, but it just throws the whole room off. I have to put them in the hamper.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m beginning to think that I am no longer a very good bachelor.</p>

<p>Oh, I can talk the talk. I can say I&#8217;ll eat cereal two meals a day, shower &#8220;later,&#8221; and stay up till 3am. Except that there are some leftovers to eat, and that sounds a little better. Or maybe pasta. Or a roast. With some potatoes and broccoli. And I will feel a lot better if I have a shower, and 3am&#8230; man, I need to get up early, I can&#8217;t do that.</p>

<p>So far, I have not shaved my face. I am counting that as a point for the &#8220;batching it&#8221; score.</p>

<p>But for now, I should get back to work. And if I&#8217;m not going to open those potato chips, I think I should really take them off the kitchen table and put them in the pantry.</p>
