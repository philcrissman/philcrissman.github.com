  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t expect to do a &#8220;code kata&#8221;-type post again so quickly, but here it is anyways.</p>

<p>I was reading Randall Hyde&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593270038?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1593270038">Writing Great Code: Volume 1</a> and came across the concept of relative primes.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard the term in awhile, relative primes are simply two numbers that are not both evenly divisible by the same value (not counting 1, of course).</p>

<p>Writing some code to determine if two integers are relatively prime seemed interesting, so I gave it a first shot:</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
# relprime01.rb

def rel_prime(a, b)  
  # if either number is one, they are automatically relatively prime.
  return true if (a == 1 || b == 1)
  
  # determine a's factors.
  fa = factors(a)
  # determine b's factors.
  fb = factors(b)
  
  # are any factors the same? then false
  # if no factors are shared, then true.
  # ie, if the intersect is empty, true, else false.
  (fa & fb).empty?
  
end

def factors(a)
  return a if a == 1
  (2..a).map{|k| k if a%k==0 }.compact
end
</code>
</pre>


<p>So, open up irb, <code>require 'rel_prime01.rb'</code>, and you have a method for determining if 2 integers are relatively prime. It has some issues, and would not be very efficient for large values. Before addressing that, I thought I&#8217;d just go straight to monkeypatching <code>Integer</code> again.</p>

<p>Note: there&#8217;s another problem with the above method, too. See it? See below the next listing for what it is.</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
# rel_prime02.rb

class Integer

  # usage: x.rel_prime?(y)
  # returns true if x and y are relatively prime.
  def rel_prime?(n)
    return true if (self.abs == 1 || n.abs == 1)
    
    # All number pairs have 1 as a shared factor; it doesn't count. So we subtract it from the array before checking [ ].empty?
    ((self.factors & n.factors) - [1]).empty?
  end

  # usage: x.factors
  # returns an array of the factors of x
  def factors
    (1..self.abs).map{|k| k if self.abs%k==0 }.compact
  end
end
</code>
</pre>


<p>Essentially the same algorithm; if either integer is 1, then the numbers are automatically relative primes; 1 has no factors other than itself, so the only factor they share is 1. If both numbers are not 1, it gets the full list of factors of both numbers, checks to see if they have any in common, returns false if they do, and true if they don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The problem fixed in the second code is the use of Integer::abs in the appropriate places; that first code listing would blow up if you supplied a negative integer. Negative integers should be allowed, so this code uses .abs to make everything work properly, as it should.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s still a big problem for checking large numbers. Each time we check relative primes, we&#8217;re getting ALL the factors of each integer, and then comparing them when we&#8217;re done. That could take a really long time, and the code above iterates though every single value from <code>1..x</code> for each <code>x</code> we give it&#8230; even if that number turns out to be (gasp!) prime. This won&#8217;t do at all. It will give us correct answers, but it will take a really long time to do it if we supply large values.</p>

<p>How could we improve it? Well, one way would be to check common factors as we go. That way, if both numbers are even, we find out they share a factor on the very first iteration, and we simply stop: they are not relatively prime. Here&#8217;s this one:</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
# rel_prime03.rb

class Integer

  # usage: x.rel_prime?(y)
  # returns true if x and y are relatively prime.
  def rel_prime?(n)
    return true if (self.abs == 1 || n.abs == 1)
    
    # different approach; go through (1..min(self,n).abs), 
    # build an array for each number's factors as we go.
    # each time you add a factor, check if the two arrays share it.
    # if they do, end right away with false; 
    # else, keep searching for common factors.
    x,y =[],[]
    
    
    (2..[self,n].sort[0].abs).each do |k|
      x << k if self % k  == 0
      y << k if n % k     == 0
      return false unless (x & y).empty?
    end
    
    # if you get here, it's because you found no common factors. return true.
    true
  end

end
</code>
</pre>


<p>So, this time we make 2 empty arrays, x and y. Each time we find a factor of self or n we add it to either x or y and then check if the intersection of those two arrays (using &amp;) is empty; if it&#8217;s ever not empty, return false right away and stop checking. If we get all the way to the end without finding a common factor, we can return true.</p>

<p>This is better; works great for large numbers IFF the common factor is a fairly low number. But what if it isn&#8217;t? What if the common factor is a 7 digit long prime number?</p>

<p>We know that there will be cases &#8230; large primes, for example &#8230; where we do basically need to check all the way up till we reach the last value that could be possible (the lesser of self and n, whichever that happens to be). But there&#8217;s a lot of number in-between that we don&#8217;t need to check. For example, if 2 is not a common factor, then we never need to check multiples of 2 again. If 3 is not a common factor, we never need to check multiples of 3 again. And so on. So really, if x is the lesser of self and n, the range we need to check will look something like:</p>

<p><code>[2,3,5,7,11,13 ... x]</code></p>

<p>Hm. That list looks familiar. Basically, we only need to check to see if prime numbers are factors of self and n; if a given prime number is not a factor, neither will any of its multiples be a factor.</p>

<p>Generating a list of primes wasn&#8217;t on the to-do list, but fortunately ruby has a class in mathn called Prime, which returns an enumerator for iterating over the prime numbers. How convenient!</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
# rel_prime04.rb
require 'mathn'

class Integer

  # usage: x.rel_prime?(y)
  # returns true if x and y are relatively prime.
  def rel_prime?(n)
    return true if (self.abs == 1 || n.abs == 1)
    
    # one more quick check; does self % n == 0?
    # if it does, we save some time; we know right away they aren't relatively prime,
    # and we don't need to iterate all the way up before we find out.
    return true if self % n == 0
    
    x,y =[],[]
    
    # Prime.instance gives us an enumerator over the Prime numbers.
    # Enumerating over only primes saves us the wasted effort 
    # of rechecking multiples of factors we've already ruled out.
    # etc.
    p = Prime.instance
    
    p.each do |k|
      x << k if self % k  == 0
      y << k if n % k     == 0
      return false unless (x & y).empty?
      break if k >= [self,n].sort[0].abs
    end
    
    # if you get here, it's because you found no common factors. return true.
    true
  end
end
</code>
</pre>


<p>Now, the above code uses Prime::instance to create the enumerator, which is a ruby 1.9 thing; you can do this in ruby 1.8.x, but you&#8217;ll need <code>Prime.new</code> instead of <code>Prime.instance</code>. Warning, though, I found that the Prime enumerator in 1.8.x was still pretty slow for larger integers. The 1.9 version is <em>very</em> fast. For easy ways to get ruby 1.9.x installed without messing too much with your existing environment, check out <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">rvm</a>.</p>

<p>So now we&#8217;re doing essentially the same as the rel_prime03.rb version, but we&#8217;re skipping the multiples of any factors we&#8217;ve already ruled out by <em>only</em> iterating through the prime numbers. In the loop, you&#8217;ll see we stop if <code>k >= [self,n].sort[0]</code>, which is the lesser of self and n (I felt like there might be a more elegant way to quickly find the lesser of two integers, but I didn&#8217;t look; anyone?).</p>

<p>One more thing was added, here: right at the beginning, after checking if self or n (abs) is equal to 1, we also check if self % n == 0. If it does, we just saved some time; see the comments in the listing above.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s that, then. A method added to Integer that checks if two integers are relatively prime.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do it? I&#8217;m fairly certain there is (there usually is), so if you know of one, feel free to leave a note or a link in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every so often I remember reading posts like <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">Why can&#8217;t programmers&#8230; program?</a>, or <a href="http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/are-you-one-of-the-10-percent/">Are you one of the 10% of programmers who can implement a binary search?</a>, or even various things about the idea of <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=code+kata&amp;v=">code kata</a>, and that makes me want to just spend a little time practicing, rather than just working. Very often while working, we&#8217;re resolving a problem we (and/or others) have solve dozens of times before, and it&#8217;s really not very challenging or stretching.</p>

<p>Since I was thinking about it, I decided to just start with the FizzBuzz example, from <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/dont-overthink-fizzbuzz.html">Reginald Braithwaite</a> via Jeff Atwood.</p>

<p>First solution:</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
(1..100).each do |k|
  print k % 3 == 0 ? "Fizz" : ""
  print k % 5 == 0 ? "Buzz" : ""
  print k unless (k % 3 == 0 || k % 5 == 0)
  print " "
end
</code>
</pre>


<p>So, that&#8217;s simple enough. I thought maybe it could be a little more compact, but essentially unchanged, here was the next version:</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
(1..100).each do |k|
  print k%3==0 ? "Fizz" : "", k%5==0 ? "Buzz" : "", (k%3==0 || k%5==0) ? "" : k,  " "
end
</code>
</pre>


<p>That&#8217;s nice and all, but I&#8217;m now trying to think if I can find other ways to do it. Preferably shorter and/or more elegant. Maybe. <code>003.rb</code> was next.</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
(1..100).each do |k|
  word = ''
  word << "Fizz" if k%3==0
  word << "Buzz" if k%5==0
  print word.empty? ? k : word, " "
end
</code>
</pre>


<p>Not really shorter or elegant, but a slightly different approach, filling a placeholder variable with &#8220;Fizz&#8221;, &#8220;Buzz&#8221; (or both), and then deciding which one to display based on whether or not the placeholder was <code>empty?</code> (If you aren&#8217;t familiar with Ruby, <code>"".empty? == true &amp;&amp; "anything".empty? == false</code>.)</p>

<p>Again, I tried to pare that down a little.</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
puts (1..100).map {|k| w='';w<<"Fizz"if k%3==0;w<<"Buzz"if k%5==0;w.empty? ? k : w }.join(" ")
</code>
</pre>


<p>Well, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s readable, or anything resembling elegant, but it&#8217;s, um&#8230; more compact.</p>

<p>At that point I glanced back at my first solution, and something was bugging me about it; oh, yeah. The ternary expressions that returned &#8220;&#8221; for the false case. That seemed unnecessary. 005.rb tries to fix it.</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
(1..100).each do |k|
  print "Fizz" if k % 3 == 0
  print "Buzz" if k % 5 == 0
  print k unless (k % 3 == 0 || k % 5 == 0)
  print " "
end
</code>
</pre>


<p>Essentially unchanged. I&#8217;m not even sure it&#8217;s any more efficient but it <em>feels</em> less like there&#8217;s wasted code in there, so I like it a little better. Now, it&#8217;s not really <em>changing</em> much, but what if we extract the logic into it&#8217;s own method?</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
def fizzbuzz(k)
  w = ''
  w << "Fizz" if k%3==0
  w << "Buzz" if k%5==0
  w.empty? ? k : w
end

(1..100).each {|k| print fizzbuzz(k), " " }
</code>
</pre>


<p>Hey, that&#8217;s&#8230; well, it&#8217;s essentially the same, but the lesser rites of refactoring have been appeased by pulling that code into it&#8217;s own little method.</p>

<p>Hey. That makes me think we could just:</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
class Integer
  def fizzbuzz
    w=''<<(self%3==0 ? "Fizz" : "")<<(self%5==0 ? "Buzz" : "")
    w.empty? ? self : w
  end
end

puts (1..100).map{|k| k.fizzbuzz }.join(" ")
</code>
</pre>


<p>So, a couple different things here. We open up <code>Integer</code> and add a fizzbuzz method to it. The idea of a place holder with either &#8220;Fizz&#8221;, &#8220;Buzz&#8221;, or both added to it is streamlined slightly by adding the concatenation lines right into the variable assignment. To make that work, we have to go back to using the ternary operator (can you see why? If we just did <code>w &lt;&lt; "Fizz" if k%3==0</code>, it would try to append <code>nil</code> to the String, and you&#8217;d get a horrible &#8220;Unable to convert nil to String&#8221; error anytime a non-multiple of 3 or 5 came up).</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s that. I know this is simple, maybe trivial, but hey, who wants to be the guy who couldn&#8217;t program a FizzBuzz solution in the interview?</p>

<p>This was a fun exercise, so I&#8217;ll probably try to do some more like it. I&#8217;ll likely start by mining Code Kata, implementing some algorithms, or something. Feel free to leave problem suggestions in the comments.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a response to no demand whatsoever, I nevertheless extracted my theme for this blog into it&#8217;s own standalone theme for <a href="http://cloudhead.io/toto">toto</a> that you could use just like <a href="http://github.com/cloudhead/dorothy">dorothy</a></p>

<p>Keeping with the Oz names, I called it <a href="http://github.com/philcrissman/henry">henry</a>.</p>

<p>Installation is pretty much identical as you would to for toto and dorothy:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
gem install toto
git clone git://github.com/philcrissman/henry.git myblog
cd myblog
heroku create myblog
git push heroku master
</code>
</pre>


<p>Now, I pretty much completely disregarded IE support when I designed the blog, so as a result I don&#8217;t think henry will look like anything much in IE. You&#8217;re on your own. I will probably eventually feel like I should update this or address it somehow, but I&#8217;m not making any guarantees as to when that would be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quite often I&#8217;ll come into a Rails project with a good portion of the code already written. Depending on style the developers were using, this sometimes means that I may not be able to easily tell, when looking at a given view, how the view is being generated. The URL may <em>say</em> /pages/1, but for all I know, the routes file has instructions to use the ArmpitsController when it sees a route for pages/*; the URL might say /user/login, but for all we know, that may map to SessionController::sign_in. In other words, it&#8217;s not always clear.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s not even getting into the cases where there are multiple partials being used, some of which might be in app/views/shared, or who knows where.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve talked in the office a few times about a mythical plugin that could provide a little output stating exactly what controller, action, and template are being rendered, as well as any and all partials. Thus the idea for WhinyRendering was born.</p>

<p>If any of the preceding scenario sounds familiar, I hope it&#8217;s helpful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Taptaptap made an extension that <a href="http://taptaptap.com/blog/speaking-of-comments/">adds comments</a> to <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, and, as you can see in the comments, sparked a little debate on whether or not this was A Good Thing.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s fine. I mean, I don&#8217;t really care if I can comment on DF or not, but if someone wants to, and if people use this and like it, great. It&#8217;s the web. You can&#8217;t control how people view your page. They could view it on any browser, with any extension, greasemonkey script, or other shenanigans inbetween, and there is absolutely nothing you or I can do about it.</p>

<p>They can <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865/">block</a> <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">your</a> <a href="http://safariadblock.com/">ads</a>. And that&#8217;s fine, because it&#8217;s their computer, and they can do that if they want to. Period.</p>

<p>They can implement their own stylesheets for your site (yes! they can!) and they will never again see the letter-spacing and line-height choices you painstakingly tested and implemented the last time you redesigned your blog. They can view your articles through <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> or something like it.</p>

<p>It just is. That&#8217;s just how the web is set up to work. And it&#8217;s a good thing. <em>It doesn&#8217;t matter</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Struck by some sort of errant whim to get more edumacated, I started googling Computer Science Master&#8217;s Degree programs today. Actually, I did one google search and then jumped straight to the <a href="http://www.stthomas.edu/gradsoftware/programs/ms/default.html">University of St. Thomas</a> page on graduate programs in software. Did a little back of the envelope thinking, noted that St. Thomas wants $762.50 per credit, and decided against a Masters degree at this point in time.</p>

<p>But it did get me thinking. Why would I <em>want</em> a Masters Degree, anyways? All the reasons I could think of boiled down to these two:</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to go into a role, career, or position that <em>requires</em> a Masters Degree.</li>
<li>I want to go into a role, career, or position that requires the <em>knowledge</em> presumably attained from a Masters Degree.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is a pretty important distinction. Some roles might simply have a Masters as a <em>requirement</em>. Doesn&#8217;t actually mean they care if you <em>know</em> anything. Yes, of course, they assume that you do, and that your Masters actually means something, but really, for this type of thing, all that&#8217;s important is the piece of paper.</p>

<p>And the truth is, I&#8217;m not really interested in any of those roles. Off the top of my head, all I could come up with in that category would be roles in a Fortune 500 or similarly credential-obsessed enterprise, or a role at a University, neither of which is something I want to pursue.</p>

<p>On the other hand, maybe I just want to <em>know</em> the information I might learn in a Masters program. Or maybe I have my sights on a career that really requires the <em>knowledge</em>, but doesn&#8217;t necessarily care if I have the piece of paper or not. That sort of role might include (again, off the top of my head), the technical founder or lead in a startup, a writer or speaker about tech topics, or simply a kick-ass software developer who knows more this year than he did last year. Now <em>those</em> sorts of things are interesting.</p>

<p>All of which means it doesn&#8217;t really matter if I go to a University.</p>

<p>Continuing on with this line of thought, I started mulling over the knowledge I&#8217;ve accumulated so far. How much would I attribute to college education, and how much did I teach myself? It&#8217;s a little hard to quantify, because there&#8217;s a lot of overlap, but even allowing some margin of error, the topics which I&#8217;ve taught myself have been far more useful/valuable than those I learned in my undergraduate degree (which was in Computer Science).</p>

<p>More importantly, and maybe more telling, I have a far better grasp on the things that I&#8217;ve taught myself than I do on many of the things I &#8220;had&#8221; to learn in college. I know Ruby and Rails far better than I know Java, and I&#8217;ve had <em>at least</em> four or five college courses dedicated to Java (most of which, <em>even the 4th year course in Operating Systems</em>, assumed we didn&#8217;t know anything about Java or OOP and re-taught it all over again).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to make a suggestion as to why this might be. I&#8217;m going to suggest that when we&#8217;re teaching something to ourselves, we hold ourselves to a higher standard than the average college course holds us.</p>

<p>In an average college class, all that really matters is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Attendance (as crazy as it sounds, evidently they actually still care if you attend class, for reasons unfathomable to me).</li>
<li>Making an average effort to skim the material.</li>
<li>Making an average effort to complete assignments (often can combine with #2, as usually the only material you ever need to read is whatever is pertinent to the assignment).</li>
<li>Remembering <em>just enough</em> information for <em>just long enough</em> to have an adequate number of correct answers on your exams.</li>
</ol>


<p>(Aside: the possible exception to this is Calculus and other advanced math classes, unless you are one of those people who absorb that with a minimum of effort; you either understand Calculus (et. al.), or you don&#8217;t, you can&#8217;t really just push your way through those one. YMMV.)</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re teaching <em>yourself</em>, on the other hand:</p>

<ol>
<li>While you <em>are</em> working at your own pace, chances are you actually want to <em>use</em> the information or ideas that you&#8217;re learning, so you don&#8217;t want it to take forever. You may or may not have a fixed deadline in mind, but regardless, you are motivated to make progress for it&#8217;s own sake, not simply to get to the end of a semester.</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t fake yourself out. You can&#8217;t tell yourself that you know something when you know you don&#8217;t. You won&#8217;t fool yourself into thinking that you understand lambdas, or ruby blocks, or closures, or monads, or red-black trees, or any data structure or algorithm, if you <em>know</em> that you don&#8217;t. So if it matters to you that you learn it, you just have to keep going back until you get it.</li>
<li>Again, you have some reason that you actually <em>want to use</em> this information. It&#8217;s not solely to check of a list (e.g., Okay, I have memorized a bunch of ideas about Design Patterns, check), but it&#8217;s because you want to <em>do</em> something with the knowledge once you have it (e.g., Okay, I&#8217;ve learned some design patterns. Am I using any of these in my software side projects? If I did use one, would it improve my application? Can I identify these patterns if I see them in the wild? Etc.)</li>
<li>Not only can you not fake yourself out, you probably underestimate yourself. When you&#8217;re teaching yourself, your often painfully aware of how much you still <em>don&#8217;t</em> know, how much you still have left to learn, and it frequently blinds you to how much you&#8217;ve actually learned so far. Why is this good? Well, eventually you do need to recognize your progress and give yourself a pat or two on the back, but in general I think it&#8217;s good because it means you&#8217;ll push yourself harder to learn more. A good way to gauge your progress is to join a forum, a StackOverflow-type site, or an IRC chat room in the area you&#8217;re studying, and look at the questions people are asking. Chances are you&#8217;re going to find that a lot of people are asking questions that you (gasp) already know the answers to (now would be a nice time to help them, if you have time). That&#8217;s a good sign.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, self-discipline, which I didn&#8217;t mention, may or may not be an issue. An oft-mentioned advantage of college or course-work in general is that it pushes you to learn faster because of the built in deadlines, exams and assignments. The problem is, as I argued above, that yes, it may push you to accomplish specific milestones, but all too often this means you are <em>pushed to accomplish the bare minimum with the least effort at the last minute</em>.</p>

<p>And don&#8217;t tell me that means I&#8217;m just &#8220;not a very good student&#8221;, then. Sure, if you can combine powerful self-motivation with college coursework, you can get more than the &#8220;minimum&#8221; amount of education from a class, and some students do. So have I, in some courses.</p>

<p>But for better or worse, I&#8217;ve found that in many courses the combination of arbitrary requirements (i.e., the need to be present in class), <em>horrible</em> textbooks, frequently unenthusiastic professors (sorry guys; to be <em>interesting</em> you have to <em>be interested</em> in what you&#8217;re talking about), and a highly subjective qualification for success (complete these <em>n</em> assignments and learn these <em>n</em> concepts well enough to pass an exam or two), means that the very structure and implementation of a college class encourages you to do <em>just enough to get by and no more</em>, period.</p>

<p>(Aside: on horrible textbooks: the only textbooks I&#8217;ve wanted to keep from my entire time obtaining a computer science degree have been Sipser&#8217;s <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0534950973?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0534950973">Introduction to the Theory of Computation</a></cite> and Larman&#8217;s <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131489062?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0131489062">Applying UML and Patterns</a></cite>; and of those, I gotta say, the Larman book is pretty boring (sorry, Craig, maybe we can blame your editors), but there&#8217;s some good material in there.)</p>

<p>So, enough complaining about colleges. I don&#8217;t really have any suggestions for how to fix the education system, if indeed it is broken &#8211; I&#8217;ll leave it to others to debate and solve that problem. But since I&#8217;m convinced that self-learning is more productive and more effective, then if I&#8217;m interested in the information that I might learn in a Masters Program in Computer Science, it seems reasonable that I&#8217;d be better off concocting my own program and just starting to plug away.</p>

<p>At the top of this article I put a link to the University of St. Thomas&#8217; graduate program in Software Engineering. Suppose we take that as a model and make a plan.</p>

<p>Required courses we have:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Foundations of Software Development. It&#8217;s waivable with experience, and if you&#8217;re even reading or contemplating doing something remotely like this, I&#8217;m going to guess you and I can waive this one. We&#8217;re assuming you can already code your way out of a paper bag, people. If you can&#8217;t do the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">FizzBuzz problem</a> or <a href="http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/are-you-one-of-the-10-percent/">write a binary search given the description</a>, then you can&#8217;t waive this. Get up to speed, folks.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical Communication. Writing and speaking. I can see it being useful, but you&#8217;re going to have to decide if it something you want to be good at it. If it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a technical blog. Force yourself to do it semi-regularly. Explain a concept, how you solved a problem, why something is the way it is, etc. You&#8217;re not doing it to become a ProBloggerSuperStar, you&#8217;re doing it to improve your written communication skills.</li>
<li>Find &amp; join a local users group in your field of interest (say, Ruby, Java, Cocoa, whatever) and give a presentation. At least one, to start. In anything. If this is something you want to be a lot better at, try to think of several presentations you could give; then volunteer to give them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Software Engineering. Read (or re-read) <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0735619670">Code Complete</a></cite>. The St. Thomas course description also includes the idea of estimating, so Mike Cohn&#8217;s <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131479415?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0131479415">Agile Estimating And Planning</a></cite> might also be apropos. If you&#8217;ve read both of those, then scan them to make sure you&#8217;re still up to speed and either a) give yourself a pass, you&#8217;ve got this one, or b) re-read or pick an alternate/more advanced tome on the subject and plow through it.</p></li>
<li><p>Database Management Systems And Design. I&#8217;m assuming you already know and use regularly at least one or more DB system; probably MySQL, but possibly sqlite, Postgres, or even MS SQL Server or Oracle. Great. Maybe you even know CouchDB or MongoDB or some other NoSQL system. Well, this is a Masters program. That&#8217;s Not Good Enough.</p>

<ul>
<li>Give yourself a refresher in DB design, SQL, maybe relational algebra if you like that sort of thing. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596100124?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596100124">Database in Depth</a></em> is a good book. You might know others.</li>
<li>Learn another system, whatever seems most useful to what you are doing (remember a HUGE key in making this work is that it must be something you really want to know about; follow what interests you): maybe a NoSQL db, or maybe Postgres. Learn what makes this DB different from others, from what you know already, and why. Try to figure out real reasons and/or scenarios you&#8217;d want to use one or the other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>OOAAD (Object Oriented Application Analysis and Design). Well you could read or re-read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131489062?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0131489062">Larman</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020189551X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=020189551X">Booch</a>, and that&#8217;s probably not a bad idea. Try to make it applicable to things you want to work on, as always.</p></li>
<li><p>Software Project Management. This is an area I could probably stand to improve in; I&#8217;m not certain, but I think I&#8217;d start with one or more of Scott Berkun&#8217;s books (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007868?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596007868">The Art of Project Management</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517718?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596517718">Making Things Happen</a>) on the topic, which seem to have attained a sort of Gold Standard status. If you&#8217;re certification-minded you might reach for a PMP-based book. I&#8217;m not gung-ho on certifications, but maybe you think it will be good to have; and honestly, of all the certs out there, this one seems the most useful. If you have experience with PMP pro or con that you&#8217;d like to leave in the comments, please do, but remember that the whole point of this plan is to be more interested in <em>results</em> than <em>whether or not my certification can get me a job with SAP</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Software Quality Assurance. This would be the ideal place to learn even more about software testing. Aside from that, I would have to look for some specific material pertinent to Software QA; suggestions welcome.</p></li>
<li><p>Operating Systems. Yeah, I guess it&#8217;s useful. And maybe it&#8217;s super-interesting to you; at the moment it&#8217;s not an area of intense interest to me, but I can see its applicability. I&#8217;d probably start by identifying the areas in which this sort of knowledge will help the most; probably in the areas of processes, threads, memory management and related themes. Might want to brush out the old C programming toolset and pick up a book on the Linux kernel; I don&#8217;t know. Again, if the only point is to check another item off the checklist, it probably will be hell to learn and you might not even bother. So find a way to make it interesting. Maybe just spend awhile really learning or re-learning multi-threaded application programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer and Network Communications. Again, I&#8217;m guessing we have the foundations of <em>at least</em> some or much of this down. So find an area of interest to you and push your knowledge further. Learn <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and write a server. Find an Open Source server/networking project and attempt to contribute something to it (even if it&#8217;s just documentation; come to think of it, contributing to a related OSS project would be a fantastic progress gauge for every area on this list.)</p></li>
<li><p>5+ electives. There&#8217;s always more to learn; what are you most interested in?</p>

<ul>
<li>Applied Statistics/Machine Learning/Analysis</li>
<li>Other Maths? Go nuts.</li>
<li>Another programming language. Lisp, Erlang, Python, Ruby, C(++/#), Objective-C/Cocoa, Javascript&#8230; pick something that you don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;d <em>like</em> to know, and start knowing it. Since one of the major hurdles in learning a new language is the &#8220;what the heck should I write in this language?&#8221; problem, a good tactic might be to apply your new language to one of the above subject areas; do your DB, Networking, or QA/testing explorations in a language other than the ones you already know.</li>
<li>Security. Big topic.</li>
<li>Cryptography. Related to security, but also a big topic all on its own.</li>
<li>Algorithms and Data Structures. We all probably have some exposure to these, but if it&#8217;s an area of interest to you, I&#8217;m betting you&#8217;ll always learn something from a refresher course.</li>
<li>Data Warehousing/Mining/etc.</li>
<li>Distributed Databases or servers.</li>
<li>Real Time systems/concepts.</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence, related research.</li>
<li>&#8230;. ? I don&#8217;t know, you pick something you&#8217;re interested in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>There&#8217;s some of the above I feel like I have a decent grasp of, there&#8217;s some that I don&#8217;t. There&#8217;s some things that interest me, and that applies directly to the ways I pay the bills each month, so obviously those are the things I&#8217;d probably gravitate towards learning first.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to &#8220;log my progress&#8221; on following this or any similar plan, but my point is:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s doable.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s valuable in and of itself.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t need to spend 20K+ at a university to do it.</li>
<li>If/when you really have a grasp of all (or even MOST) of the above, you&#8217;re a software engineer who really knows his/her stuff, and especially if you can show the Open Source or other projects that you&#8217;ve contributed to along the way&#8230; you really don&#8217;t need the piece of paper from the university.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you don&#8217;t like my list, or the books/ideas I&#8217;ve listed, make your own. Or, you know, whatever. I think most really good developers plan to keep learning continuously anyways, and are probably already doing so; this just happens to be a little more structured list based off a given Masters program description. Part of my whole theory here is that you&#8217;re going to be more successful if you&#8217;re trying to learn things that really interest you, or that you really want to use, so if you don&#8217;t <em>care</em> about project management, or networking, or databases, then by all means, just <em>skip it</em>. Focus on what you want to know. Maybe you&#8217;d rather jump straight in to statistics and machine learning. Go download <em><a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a></em> and have a ball.</p>
