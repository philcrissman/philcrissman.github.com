***Notice of Account Closure***

Greetings,

This is a notification regarding your World of Warcraft account.  Access to this account has been permanently disabled for exploitation of the World of Warcraft economy or for being associated to accounts which have been closed for intended exploitation.  While we try to be as lenient as possible in our assessments of the results of exploitation investigations, reoccurring trends in exploitative endeavors on your account have ultimately resulted in account closure.

As a result, this account will no longer be able to access any aspect of World of Warcraft.  This action has been taken in accordance with the Terms of Use (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html) and our game policies (http://www.blizzard.com/support/wowgm/?id=agm01712p).  According to the World of Warcraft Terms of Use, to which all players agree when installing World of Warcraft, Section 3, Paragraph C [Rules Related to Game Play] states that you may not do anything that Blizzard Entertainment considers contrary to the &#8220;essence&#8221; of World of Warcraft.

Thank you for your time and understanding of our position in this matter.  Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have.

<p>Hmm. <em>Access to this account has been permanently disabled for exploitation of the World of Warcraft economy or for being associated to accounts which have been closed for intended exploitation.</em>  That&#8217;s interesting.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s especially interesting considering I cancelled my subscription over a month ago since I simply <em>did not have time to play World of Warcraft</em>. I&#8217;m fairly certain I have not logged on to any WoW server in well over two months, possibly longer.</p>

<p>I was considering re-activating the subscription at some point, if and/or when I have more free time to play MMORPG-type games (I just like typing MMORPG) &#8211; so this is a little annoying.</p>

<p>I replied to them; hopefully they can explain exactly what it is about <em>NOT PLAYING</em> that flags an account as &#8220;exploitative&#8221;.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Folks keep visiting this post, so I can only guess that this keeps happening to people, or that people are still trying to resolve it.</p>

<p>In my own case, my World of Warcraft account is <em>still closed</em>. The only means they will accept to re-open it, apparently, is for me to send them a fax (yes! a FAX) of my driver&#8217;s license. I don&#8217;t have a fax machine, nor a scanner most of the time, so I keep putting this off. I finally got around to doing it one day, and they replied that the incoming fax was too fuzzy and that I should scan my ID again and re-fax it.</p>

<p>That was about a year ago. I haven&#8217;t bothered to re-fax it yet.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/2006/09/22/the-emperors-new-web/">The Emperor&#8217;s New Web</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once upon a time there was an emperor of a far country. In this country, the internet prospered and grew, and the web was used by many of the emperor&#8217;s subjects. The emperor himself was a web aficionado, and was a great patron of Internet and web related ventures in his empire.</p>

<p>One day, two developers arrived at the palace, and asked if they could have an audience with the emperor. When pressed, they stated that their purpose was something mysterious to do with the web, in which they believed that the emperor would have great interest, but which they could not reveal to the porter unless he signed a NDA. The porter, knowing his majesty&#8217;s affinity for all things webby, immediately ushered them to the audience room.</p>

<p>When the emperor learned of their presence, he immediately went to meet them, and to ask them what it was they wished to show him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are working on a Whole New Web,&#8221; said the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be the New New Internet,&#8221; said the other.</p>

<p>The emperor raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be more responsive&#8230; more socially connected,&#8221; said the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will look fancier,&#8221; said the second. &#8220;Everything will be shiny and beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may have to stay in beta for awhile,&#8221; began the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Also &#8211; it possesses the unique quality that only those users who &#8216;get it&#8217; &#8211; users with &#8216;clue&#8217; &#8211; will be able to see it,&#8221; said the second.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the first. &#8220;You will immediately be able to tell who are the best and brightest in your empire by how they react to the New New Internet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m interested,&#8221; said the emperor. &#8220;Tell you what; you can stay in the palace, and work on this.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the two strangers began to work. For a long time, they worked in solitude, but eventually, after the emperor had signed up for their release notification mailing list several times, they announced that they were ready to show him the results of their labors.</p>

<p>Extremely excited, the emperor rushed down to the development lab. There he sat down in anticipation in front of a computer, and one of the developers clicked a link, and their new site sprang to life.</p>

<p>The emperor blinked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the first, &#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>The emperor considered. Certainly, it was very pretty. All the colors were vivid, and there was an attractive design scheme to the whole page. The logo was very shiny. It had a transparent shiny badge that said &#8220;Beta&#8221; covering one corner of it. You could connect with other users of the site. It had tags. It had RSS feeds.</p>

<p>But none of these were things that were new to his majesty the emperor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen <em>this</em>?&#8221; said the second, and he began clicking things.</p>

<p>As he clicked, various bits of the page would fade in and out, and slide around, and expand and contract. It was very slick-looking, and while it was not a completely <em>common</em> practice, the emperor was aware of how this was done, and that it had been possible to do things like this on web pages for some time.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is nice,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As we mentioned,&#8221; said the first, &#8220;Only people who &#8216;get it&#8217;, netizens with &#8216;clue&#8217; are able to see the New New Web.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anxiously, the second said, &#8220;You do <em>see it</em>, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point, the emperor was unwilling to say that he did not have &#8220;clue&#8221;, or that he did not &#8220;get it&#8221;, so he said, &#8220;Well of course I see it. It&#8217;s the new new web. I &#8216;get it&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful,&#8221; said the two developers in chorus. &#8220;We knew you would!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we just need to share this with the rest of the empire,&#8221; said the first. &#8220;You will notice that you have several &#8216;invites&#8217; to share to our beta.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps after it has spread around we can talk about second round funding,&#8221; said the second.</p>

<p>The emperor agreed, and dutifully &#8220;invited&#8221; some of his relatives and courtiers to the beta. He was sure to say that this was, indeed, <em>The New New Web</em>, and that only those &#8220;with clue&#8221; could &#8220;get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Needless to say, all of his invitees gladly proclaimed that they, too, &#8220;get it&#8221;, and began to invite others to the Emperor&#8217;s New Web.</p>

<p>All over the empire, everyone began to flock to the Emperor&#8217;s New Web, and everyone said they &#8220;got it,&#8221; and were not about to admit they did not have &#8220;clue.&#8221;</p>

<p>One day, they threw a New New Web Conference, and gathered together to talk about important things like well-styled XHTML, the use of gradients in company logos, tag clouds, and social networks. While the emperor himself was giving the keynote of the highlights of the New New Interweb, a young boy in the crowd proclaimed loudly:</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s just the same as the old web! There isn&#8217;t anything new at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause, and then the crowd began to laugh. &#8220;Pay no attention to him,&#8221; they said. &#8220;He&#8217;s just a boy. He doesn&#8217;t &#8216;get it&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it&#8217;s shiny,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;But shiny is not enough to call it a Whole New Web.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has social networking and tagging!&#8221; said someone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Social networking is not new,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;Bulletin boards are an example older as old as my parents. And surely <em>tags</em> alone are not&#8230; the Whole New Web?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has Ajax and fancy JavaScript effects!&#8221; said someone else.</p>

<p>&#8220;And those&#8230; programming languages and effects that are caught on but are not &#8216;new&#8217; at all &#8211; those are all that you are calling the New New Web?&#8221; asked the boy.</p>

<p>The emperor decided it was time to speak. &#8220;But it is the <em>combination</em> of all these elements, together, that is new.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy seemed perplexed. &#8220;Is it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The emperor stammered. The crowd began to murmur and to look suspiciously at the emperor, and at the large plasma screen which displayed a page of the Emperor&#8217;s New Web.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the emperor said, &#8220;Also, I would like to announce that I am providing first round venture capital for entrepreneurs who are developing applications for the New New Web!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, everyone in the crowd proclaimed, &#8220;Ah! Now we see it! There it is &#8211; it&#8217;s the New New Interweb!&#8221; And they began to rush forward to display their Powerpoint presentations.</p>

<p>And that is the story of the Emperor&#8217;s New Web.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/2006/07/25/howto-add-your-xscreensavers-to-gnome-screensaver/">Howto Add Your Xscreensavers to Gnome Screensaver</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The fully qualified directories in this particular &#8220;howto&#8221; are specific to SLED 10, and will undoubtedly be different on a different version of Linux.</p>

<p>Something you might notice on installing SLED 10 is that, like most distros which feature Gnome 2.12 or 2.14, xscreensaver has been partially or fully replaced by gnome-screensaver. In the case of SLED 10, xscreensaver was <em>installed</em>, but none of its screensavers were available; gnome-screensaver listed only a scant five or six options.</p>

<p>I spent some time tracking down how to make xscreensaver&#8217;s hacks available to gnome-screensaver, so here it is.</p>

<p>Each screensaver, for both gnome-screensaver and xscreensaver, has a config file. So to move files from xscreensaver to gnome-screensaver, we need to move not only the screensaver programs themselves, but also the config files.</p>

<p>Moving the screensavers is the easy part; all you&#8217;d need to do is:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>cp -i /usr/lib/xscreensaver/* /opt/gnome/lib/gnome-screensaver/gnome-screensaver/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yes, technically this code <em>copies</em> the screensavers, not moves them&#8230; but that&#8217;s okay. The -i switch is to make the process interactive; if any other the new screensavers has the same name as an existing one, it will as if you want to overwrite it, rather than just deciding for you. There should be only one such anomaly: popsquares. I chose not to overwrite it, as it works fine already and is probably exactly the same.</p>

<p>Next, you need to move the config files. The only problem is, xscreensaver config files are .xml files, and gnome-screensaver files are .desktop files.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is a problem with a ready made solution: our friends at Gnome have a script which will migrate our .xml files into .desktop files. For this to work, you&#8217;ll need 2 files:</p>

<p><a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/gnome-screensaver/data/migrate-xscreensaver-config.sh?rev=1.1&view=log">migrate-xscreensaver-config.sh</a></p>

<p><a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/gnome-screensaver/data/xscreensaver-config.xsl?rev=1.1&view=log">xscreensaver-config.xsl</a></p>

<p>Just click the &#8220;download&#8221; links on the above two pages. I moved the two files to /opt/gnome/lib/gnome-screensaver/, but you can put them anywhere &#8211; they just need to be in the same place.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll need to make migrate-xscreensaver-config.sh executable (it should go without saying, but you&#8217;ll need to execute the following command from whatever directory you put the files in):</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># chmod +x migrate-xscreensaver-config.sh</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That being done, all you&#8217;ll have left is:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># cd /opt/gnome/share/gnome-screensaver/themes/</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># /opt/gnome/lib/gnome-screensaver/migrate-xscreensaver-config.sh /etc/xscreensaver/*.xml</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&#8217;s that. You will find (at least on SLED 10) that you need to restart X &#8211; just logging out of Gnome and back in should do it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re attempting to use these steps on a different version of linux, you may need to use find or locate to figure out the proper file paths to use. Enjoy.</p>
