    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/2012/10/09/grit/">Grit?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The topic of &#8220;grit&#8221; is the focus of most of the most recent (<a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/87">#87</a>) back to work. I&#8217;ve thought along these lines a lot. Like Merlin says a couple times, I feel like if I&#8217;m honest, I&#8217;m lacking in grit. Lack of grit has been an issue in accomplishing (or rather, not accomplishing) a lot of things I&#8217;d <em>like</em> to have done.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something Merlin said in an early B2W episode that foreshadows this<a href="#one">1</a>, something said in the character of &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Merlin&#8221;-guy, along the lines of, &#8220;You know, I just can&#8217;t do these things, because I&#8217;m, like, <em>not smart</em> and, like, <em>don&#8217;t try</em>.&#8221; The &#8220;don&#8217;t try&#8221; line is the one I&#8217;m thinking of here.</p>

<blockquote><p><a name="one">1</a> <em>This blog is not intended to be an exercise in &#8220;let&#8217;s comment exclusively on things Merlin and Dan have said in the the Back to Work podcast.&#8221; It just happens that this is maybe the podcast that I listen (and relisten) to the most, and it makes me think about things, and then I want to write about said things. If it comes across as just too sycophantic or something, well, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s anything I can help you with, maybe you should read something else.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Can &#8220;grit&#8221; be developed? I want to believe it can, otherwise I&#8217;d have to resign myself to failure on a lot of areas.</p>

<p>What is &#8220;grit&#8221;? Definitions that came up were along the lines of: Self-restraint, being able to delay gratification. Stick-to-it-iveness.
<span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Very little I&#8217;ve accomplished has been because of &#8220;grit&#8221;.'>
I&#8217;ve accomplished a lot of things by being fortunate, or blessed, or just in the right place at the right time. Very little I&#8217;ve accomplished has been because of &#8220;grit&#8221;.  At least, that&#8217;s how I feel when I look back.
</span></p>

<p>Now, since I just admitted I don&#8217;t have this &#8220;grit&#8221;, here&#8217;s some completely unqualified thoughts on what I imagine <em>might</em> be a way to develop &#8220;grit&#8221;:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Narrow it down. You are just not going to be able to have a single minded dedication to all the dreams you could ever have. If you think you want to write a novel, go to law school after work, learn to program computers from scratch, learn to draw, work out and look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, and become president, well, you might need to just pick one of those and go for it. Or at least, one at a time. Someone is already reading this and mentally composing a response about how they can and will achieve all their dreams all at once. Which is great, but&#8230; For most of us, if we actually want to accomplish something, we should probably dial it down. I&#8217;m not saying &#8220;don&#8217;t havebig goals&#8221;&mdash;just, maybe, don&#8217;t have <em>20</em> big goals. Pick one. The hardest part, I think, is deciding what you really care about.</p></li>
<li><p>A blueprint. Figure out the plan. The whole plan. If you really want to write a novel, figure out how to do that. Sure, maybe read about it, that&#8217;s important, but don&#8217;t read about it so much that you never actually start doing it. Figure out who what where when how, figure out how many words a day you would need to write, or how many words you <em>can</em> write, and make a plan when each day you&#8217;ll do that. Then do that the first day. Then the second day.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='This is the step where you simply keep at it, and it feels like a catch-22, like the way to have grit is just to _have grit_'>
3. ??? Around here&#8230; I don&#8217;t know this step. If I did, I guess I would be someone who already <em>has</em> grit. This is the step where you simply keep at it, and it feels like a catch-22, like the way to have grit is just to <em>have grit</em>, which sounds a little motivational speaky, but is also sort of true (at least in the sense that its a tautology). But what if my problem is, I don&#8217;t stick with things? How do I say, <em>this</em> is the thing that I stick with? You could focus on the goal, the finish line. That sounds like a thing that people say, people who talk about these things. But so, how do you <em>do</em> that?
</span></p>

<p>One thought could be, just continue to focus on your goal, on the &#8220;end&#8221; you want to arrive at. If you continue to focus on your &#8220;goal/end&#8221; (eg I want to have finished a novel) and if that vision is still not enough to get you to write a thousand or 500 or even 100 words a day, well, maybe you don&#8217;t really want to do this thing <em>that</em> badly. Sorry. Maybe you need to find a new thing.</p>

<p>See since we&#8217;re talking about novels (which I do actually want to write, and I&#8217;m beginning to think that maybe I actually don&#8217;t care about it enough to ever do it) I&#8217;m reminded of some advice I read in a writing book, I think it was by Lawrence Block. He said you should take a novel that you like, and dissect it. Use a series of colored pencils and highlight the entire book. Mark with one color where a new character is introduced, or where a goal or a conflict or (etc) happens, until you have dissected the structure/framework if the whole novel. Then just plain copy it. As if you we&#8217;re plugging in your characters for theirs, your story goals for theirs, your settings for theirs, and just write it. His point was, if you do this, it will be this sort of derivative copy novel that sort of sucks, but it <em>will</em> be a novel, with characters and a story and a beginning middle and end (because you straight out copied an existing work that had all these things), and you will have <em>finished</em> it, it will exist. Basically, write one to throw away. So, yeah, it will almost definitely be a bad novel and you won&#8217;t ever want to show it to anyone. But you will have done it, and you&#8217;ll have learned a lot about how a novel works and is structured and how it gets from point a to the conclusion.</p>

<p>Now here&#8217;s the thing: if you&#8217;re like me, you might have just read that, and think it makes sense and would work and you <em>still</em> think that you&#8217;re special and you can skip this step and just write your real novel. And if you&#8217;re like me, you still haven&#8217;t ever done it.</p>

<p>It takes grit to write an entire novel that you know will suck and no one will ever read or publish. But what if <em>doing</em> that meant that next, you really <em>could</em> write that real novel that you actually want to write?</p>

<p>Grit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying that the above strategy would work, though it probably wouldn&#8217;t hurt and is probably better than never writing anything, but it&#8217;s something to think about: the idea that if you aren&#8217;t willing to pay the price to reach your goal, well, maybe you just don&#8217;t care enough about that goal. Maybe you need a new goal. Selah.</p>

<p>What is the thing that, thinking about it as though it were really possible, as though it were real, could motivate you to take the steps to make it real?</p>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;ve spilled over into Tony Robbins territory, but think about it anyways. What is it that you care enough about to pay the price to make it happen? And if you don&#8217;t care about anything that much, what would that thing be if you <em>could</em>, and is there any way you could <em>make</em> yourself care that much about it?</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t care that much about the think that you think you want to be your goal, try to imagine what it would feel like to care that much. Picture how you would feel if you were that sort of person. Again, more hippie motivational stuff. Throw it away if it sounds dumb to you. But you never know. It could help.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/2012/10/03/nothing-just-happens/">Nothing &#8216;Just Happens&#8217;.</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>More from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Sim">Dave Sim</a>, this time from the <a href="http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/nftp/185.php">Note from the President in #185</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Self-publishing does not just happen. Even if I put everything that I know about self-publishing into a single volume and mailed a copy free to everyone who wrote in asking for advice, self-publishing would not just happen. One of the biggest obstacles you are going to face in trying to self-publish is your own inertia. Jeff Smith&#8217;s standard advice is to &#8216;do your homework&#8217;. By this he means that you should find out everything about publishing and distribution before you even attempt to enter the field. &#8216;Doing your homework&#8217; is very different, however, from the traditional view of that phrase, which has come to mean (in the last half of the twentieth century) send a list of thirty-five questions to an expert and then sit back and wait for a reply.</p>

<p>Understand this:</p>

<p>Not only doesn&#8217;t the world revolve around you, NOTHING revolves around you. You are a human being. Picture yourself as a planet. Your talent, your intended comic book, your story-to-be is your molten core. It is up to you to make an environment for that molten core which is conducive to growth, which will permit your talent to flourish in a hostile world. There are any number of ways to go about this. I always recommend that the story has to come first. You have to have something to say. The only way to find out if you have something to say and the determination and work ethic to see it through to its conclusion is to make a start and stick with it. I find, at this point, that most would-be self-publishers&#8217; eyes start to glaze over.</p>

<p>SNAP SNAP.</p>

<p>WAKE UP!</p></blockquote>

<p>Love this. For years before I left Full Time Employment and went freelance, I would always look at anyone who was self-employed, or a contractor, or working freelance, and be a little jealous, and I would want to ask them <em>how do you do that?</em>, by which I really meant, <em>how can I do that?</em> Invariably, I wasn&#8217;t happy with the answer(s) I recieved. I always felt like there was some sort of magic dust that I was missing which would help me to suddenly &#8220;go freelance&#8221;.</p>

<p>What the &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; actually turned out to be was to just <em>quit</em> a full time IT role at Oracle in exchange for a 3-month contract at a pretty low freelancing rate, because honestly, I really had no idea what I was doing at that point.</p>

<p><em>3 months?</em></p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p><em>But what did you plan to do after 3 months?</em></p>

<p>I had no idea. It turned out that the initial 3 months turned into 6 months, after which I was able to go do some work for a different local developer, and so on. In retrospect, I was incredibly fortunate. But I also would never have experienced that &#8220;good fortune&#8221; without just making a start, essentially jumping without a net. I&#8217;m still not sure how my wife dealt with the stress of my taking that leap. It&#8217;s worked out fine&mdash;better than we could have predicted, really, as I&#8217;ve been able to raise my rates substantially over the past 4+ years, and we&#8217;re now doing far better, financially, than if I had just kept my safe corporate job. My first freelancing contract was essentially a paid internship in Ruby on Rails and independent consulting and I&#8217;ll be forever grateful that I had that opportunity.</p>

<p>But there was certainly no way to predict that when I took the leap.</p>

<p>When I think about it now, it seems like one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve ever made. But prior to that, all my thinking and wishing about &#8220;going independent&#8221; was pretty much exactly what Dave Sim describes in the arena of self-publishing; I was hoping to find some nugget of knowledge, some magic step that would cause my indepence to &#8220;just happen&#8221;.</p>

<p>Nothing &#8220;just happens&#8221;.</p>

<p>Except maybe entropy.</p>
