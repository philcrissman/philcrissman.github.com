<blockquote>&#8230; One of the main differences between programs you develop in school and those you develop as a professional is that the design problems solved by school programs are rarely, if ever, wicked. &#8230; You&#8217;d probably want to tar and feather a teacher who gave you a programming assignment, then changed the assignment as soon as you finished the design, and then changed it again just as you were about to turn in the completed program.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Struck by some sort of errant whim to get more edumacated, I started googling Computer Science Master&#8217;s Degree programs today. Actually, I did one google search and then jumped straight to the <a href="http://www.stthomas.edu/gradsoftware/programs/ms/default.html">University of St. Thomas</a> page on graduate programs in software. Did a little back of the envelope thinking, noted that St. Thomas wants $762.50 per credit, and decided against a Masters degree at this point in time.</p>

<p>But it did get me thinking. Why would I <em>want</em> a Masters Degree, anyways? All the reasons I could think of boiled down to these two:</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to go into a role, career, or position that <em>requires</em> a Masters Degree.</li>
<li>I want to go into a role, career, or position that requires the <em>knowledge</em> presumably attained from a Masters Degree.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is a pretty important distinction. Some roles might simply have a Masters as a <em>requirement</em>. Doesn&#8217;t actually mean they care if you <em>know</em> anything. Yes, of course, they assume that you do, and that your Masters actually means something, but really, for this type of thing, all that&#8217;s important is the piece of paper.</p>

<p>And the truth is, I&#8217;m not really interested in any of those roles. Off the top of my head, all I could come up with in that category would be roles in a Fortune 500 or similarly credential-obsessed enterprise, or a role at a University, neither of which is something I want to pursue.</p>

<p>On the other hand, maybe I just want to <em>know</em> the information I might learn in a Masters program. Or maybe I have my sights on a career that really requires the <em>knowledge</em>, but doesn&#8217;t necessarily care if I have the piece of paper or not. That sort of role might include (again, off the top of my head), the technical founder or lead in a startup, a writer or speaker about tech topics, or simply a kick-ass software developer who knows more this year than he did last year. Now <em>those</em> sorts of things are interesting.</p>

<p>All of which means it doesn&#8217;t really matter if I go to a University.</p>

<p>Continuing on with this line of thought, I started mulling over the knowledge I&#8217;ve accumulated so far. How much would I attribute to college education, and how much did I teach myself? It&#8217;s a little hard to quantify, because there&#8217;s a lot of overlap, but even allowing some margin of error, the topics which I&#8217;ve taught myself have been far more useful/valuable than those I learned in my undergraduate degree (which was in Computer Science).</p>

<p>More importantly, and maybe more telling, I have a far better grasp on the things that I&#8217;ve taught myself than I do on many of the things I &#8220;had&#8221; to learn in college. I know Ruby and Rails far better than I know Java, and I&#8217;ve had <em>at least</em> four or five college courses dedicated to Java (most of which, <em>even the 4th year course in Operating Systems</em>, assumed we didn&#8217;t know anything about Java or OOP and re-taught it all over again).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to make a suggestion as to why this might be. I&#8217;m going to suggest that when we&#8217;re teaching something to ourselves, we hold ourselves to a higher standard than the average college course holds us.</p>

<p>In an average college class, all that really matters is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Attendance (as crazy as it sounds, evidently they actually still care if you attend class, for reasons unfathomable to me).</li>
<li>Making an average effort to skim the material.</li>
<li>Making an average effort to complete assignments (often can combine with #2, as usually the only material you ever need to read is whatever is pertinent to the assignment).</li>
<li>Remembering <em>just enough</em> information for <em>just long enough</em> to have an adequate number of correct answers on your exams.</li>
</ol>


<p>(Aside: the possible exception to this is Calculus and other advanced math classes, unless you are one of those people who absorb that with a minimum of effort; you either understand Calculus (et. al.), or you don&#8217;t, you can&#8217;t really just push your way through those one. YMMV.)</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re teaching <em>yourself</em>, on the other hand:</p>

<ol>
<li>While you <em>are</em> working at your own pace, chances are you actually want to <em>use</em> the information or ideas that you&#8217;re learning, so you don&#8217;t want it to take forever. You may or may not have a fixed deadline in mind, but regardless, you are motivated to make progress for it&#8217;s own sake, not simply to get to the end of a semester.</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t fake yourself out. You can&#8217;t tell yourself that you know something when you know you don&#8217;t. You won&#8217;t fool yourself into thinking that you understand lambdas, or ruby blocks, or closures, or monads, or red-black trees, or any data structure or algorithm, if you <em>know</em> that you don&#8217;t. So if it matters to you that you learn it, you just have to keep going back until you get it.</li>
<li>Again, you have some reason that you actually <em>want to use</em> this information. It&#8217;s not solely to check of a list (e.g., Okay, I have memorized a bunch of ideas about Design Patterns, check), but it&#8217;s because you want to <em>do</em> something with the knowledge once you have it (e.g., Okay, I&#8217;ve learned some design patterns. Am I using any of these in my software side projects? If I did use one, would it improve my application? Can I identify these patterns if I see them in the wild? Etc.)</li>
<li>Not only can you not fake yourself out, you probably underestimate yourself. When you&#8217;re teaching yourself, your often painfully aware of how much you still <em>don&#8217;t</em> know, how much you still have left to learn, and it frequently blinds you to how much you&#8217;ve actually learned so far. Why is this good? Well, eventually you do need to recognize your progress and give yourself a pat or two on the back, but in general I think it&#8217;s good because it means you&#8217;ll push yourself harder to learn more. A good way to gauge your progress is to join a forum, a StackOverflow-type site, or an IRC chat room in the area you&#8217;re studying, and look at the questions people are asking. Chances are you&#8217;re going to find that a lot of people are asking questions that you (gasp) already know the answers to (now would be a nice time to help them, if you have time). That&#8217;s a good sign.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, self-discipline, which I didn&#8217;t mention, may or may not be an issue. An oft-mentioned advantage of college or course-work in general is that it pushes you to learn faster because of the built in deadlines, exams and assignments. The problem is, as I argued above, that yes, it may push you to accomplish specific milestones, but all too often this means you are <em>pushed to accomplish the bare minimum with the least effort at the last minute</em>.</p>

<p>And don&#8217;t tell me that means I&#8217;m just &#8220;not a very good student&#8221;, then. Sure, if you can combine powerful self-motivation with college coursework, you can get more than the &#8220;minimum&#8221; amount of education from a class, and some students do. So have I, in some courses.</p>

<p>But for better or worse, I&#8217;ve found that in many courses the combination of arbitrary requirements (i.e., the need to be present in class), <em>horrible</em> textbooks, frequently unenthusiastic professors (sorry guys; to be <em>interesting</em> you have to <em>be interested</em> in what you&#8217;re talking about), and a highly subjective qualification for success (complete these <em>n</em> assignments and learn these <em>n</em> concepts well enough to pass an exam or two), means that the very structure and implementation of a college class encourages you to do <em>just enough to get by and no more</em>, period.</p>

<p>(Aside: on horrible textbooks: the only textbooks I&#8217;ve wanted to keep from my entire time obtaining a computer science degree have been Sipser&#8217;s <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0534950973?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0534950973">Introduction to the Theory of Computation</a></cite> and Larman&#8217;s <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131489062?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0131489062">Applying UML and Patterns</a></cite>; and of those, I gotta say, the Larman book is pretty boring (sorry, Craig, maybe we can blame your editors), but there&#8217;s some good material in there.)</p>

<p>So, enough complaining about colleges. I don&#8217;t really have any suggestions for how to fix the education system, if indeed it is broken &#8211; I&#8217;ll leave it to others to debate and solve that problem. But since I&#8217;m convinced that self-learning is more productive and more effective, then if I&#8217;m interested in the information that I might learn in a Masters Program in Computer Science, it seems reasonable that I&#8217;d be better off concocting my own program and just starting to plug away.</p>

<p>At the top of this article I put a link to the University of St. Thomas&#8217; graduate program in Software Engineering. Suppose we take that as a model and make a plan.</p>

<p>Required courses we have:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Foundations of Software Development. It&#8217;s waivable with experience, and if you&#8217;re even reading or contemplating doing something remotely like this, I&#8217;m going to guess you and I can waive this one. We&#8217;re assuming you can already code your way out of a paper bag, people. If you can&#8217;t do the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">FizzBuzz problem</a> or <a href="http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/are-you-one-of-the-10-percent/">write a binary search given the description</a>, then you can&#8217;t waive this. Get up to speed, folks.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical Communication. Writing and speaking. I can see it being useful, but you&#8217;re going to have to decide if it something you want to be good at it. If it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a technical blog. Force yourself to do it semi-regularly. Explain a concept, how you solved a problem, why something is the way it is, etc. You&#8217;re not doing it to become a ProBloggerSuperStar, you&#8217;re doing it to improve your written communication skills.</li>
<li>Find &amp; join a local users group in your field of interest (say, Ruby, Java, Cocoa, whatever) and give a presentation. At least one, to start. In anything. If this is something you want to be a lot better at, try to think of several presentations you could give; then volunteer to give them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Software Engineering. Read (or re-read) <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0735619670">Code Complete</a></cite>. The St. Thomas course description also includes the idea of estimating, so Mike Cohn&#8217;s <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131479415?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0131479415">Agile Estimating And Planning</a></cite> might also be apropos. If you&#8217;ve read both of those, then scan them to make sure you&#8217;re still up to speed and either a) give yourself a pass, you&#8217;ve got this one, or b) re-read or pick an alternate/more advanced tome on the subject and plow through it.</p></li>
<li><p>Database Management Systems And Design. I&#8217;m assuming you already know and use regularly at least one or more DB system; probably MySQL, but possibly sqlite, Postgres, or even MS SQL Server or Oracle. Great. Maybe you even know CouchDB or MongoDB or some other NoSQL system. Well, this is a Masters program. That&#8217;s Not Good Enough.</p>

<ul>
<li>Give yourself a refresher in DB design, SQL, maybe relational algebra if you like that sort of thing. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596100124?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596100124">Database in Depth</a></em> is a good book. You might know others.</li>
<li>Learn another system, whatever seems most useful to what you are doing (remember a HUGE key in making this work is that it must be something you really want to know about; follow what interests you): maybe a NoSQL db, or maybe Postgres. Learn what makes this DB different from others, from what you know already, and why. Try to figure out real reasons and/or scenarios you&#8217;d want to use one or the other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>OOAAD (Object Oriented Application Analysis and Design). Well you could read or re-read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131489062?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0131489062">Larman</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020189551X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=020189551X">Booch</a>, and that&#8217;s probably not a bad idea. Try to make it applicable to things you want to work on, as always.</p></li>
<li><p>Software Project Management. This is an area I could probably stand to improve in; I&#8217;m not certain, but I think I&#8217;d start with one or more of Scott Berkun&#8217;s books (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007868?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596007868">The Art of Project Management</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517718?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=idepermin-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596517718">Making Things Happen</a>) on the topic, which seem to have attained a sort of Gold Standard status. If you&#8217;re certification-minded you might reach for a PMP-based book. I&#8217;m not gung-ho on certifications, but maybe you think it will be good to have; and honestly, of all the certs out there, this one seems the most useful. If you have experience with PMP pro or con that you&#8217;d like to leave in the comments, please do, but remember that the whole point of this plan is to be more interested in <em>results</em> than <em>whether or not my certification can get me a job with SAP</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Software Quality Assurance. This would be the ideal place to learn even more about software testing. Aside from that, I would have to look for some specific material pertinent to Software QA; suggestions welcome.</p></li>
<li><p>Operating Systems. Yeah, I guess it&#8217;s useful. And maybe it&#8217;s super-interesting to you; at the moment it&#8217;s not an area of intense interest to me, but I can see its applicability. I&#8217;d probably start by identifying the areas in which this sort of knowledge will help the most; probably in the areas of processes, threads, memory management and related themes. Might want to brush out the old C programming toolset and pick up a book on the Linux kernel; I don&#8217;t know. Again, if the only point is to check another item off the checklist, it probably will be hell to learn and you might not even bother. So find a way to make it interesting. Maybe just spend awhile really learning or re-learning multi-threaded application programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer and Network Communications. Again, I&#8217;m guessing we have the foundations of <em>at least</em> some or much of this down. So find an area of interest to you and push your knowledge further. Learn <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and write a server. Find an Open Source server/networking project and attempt to contribute something to it (even if it&#8217;s just documentation; come to think of it, contributing to a related OSS project would be a fantastic progress gauge for every area on this list.)</p></li>
<li><p>5+ electives. There&#8217;s always more to learn; what are you most interested in?</p>

<ul>
<li>Applied Statistics/Machine Learning/Analysis</li>
<li>Other Maths? Go nuts.</li>
<li>Another programming language. Lisp, Erlang, Python, Ruby, C(++/#), Objective-C/Cocoa, Javascript&#8230; pick something that you don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;d <em>like</em> to know, and start knowing it. Since one of the major hurdles in learning a new language is the &#8220;what the heck should I write in this language?&#8221; problem, a good tactic might be to apply your new language to one of the above subject areas; do your DB, Networking, or QA/testing explorations in a language other than the ones you already know.</li>
<li>Security. Big topic.</li>
<li>Cryptography. Related to security, but also a big topic all on its own.</li>
<li>Algorithms and Data Structures. We all probably have some exposure to these, but if it&#8217;s an area of interest to you, I&#8217;m betting you&#8217;ll always learn something from a refresher course.</li>
<li>Data Warehousing/Mining/etc.</li>
<li>Distributed Databases or servers.</li>
<li>Real Time systems/concepts.</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence, related research.</li>
<li>&#8230;. ? I don&#8217;t know, you pick something you&#8217;re interested in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>There&#8217;s some of the above I feel like I have a decent grasp of, there&#8217;s some that I don&#8217;t. There&#8217;s some things that interest me, and that applies directly to the ways I pay the bills each month, so obviously those are the things I&#8217;d probably gravitate towards learning first.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to &#8220;log my progress&#8221; on following this or any similar plan, but my point is:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s doable.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s valuable in and of itself.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t need to spend 20K+ at a university to do it.</li>
<li>If/when you really have a grasp of all (or even MOST) of the above, you&#8217;re a software engineer who really knows his/her stuff, and especially if you can show the Open Source or other projects that you&#8217;ve contributed to along the way&#8230; you really don&#8217;t need the piece of paper from the university.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you don&#8217;t like my list, or the books/ideas I&#8217;ve listed, make your own. Or, you know, whatever. I think most really good developers plan to keep learning continuously anyways, and are probably already doing so; this just happens to be a little more structured list based off a given Masters program description. Part of my whole theory here is that you&#8217;re going to be more successful if you&#8217;re trying to learn things that really interest you, or that you really want to use, so if you don&#8217;t <em>care</em> about project management, or networking, or databases, then by all means, just <em>skip it</em>. Focus on what you want to know. Maybe you&#8217;d rather jump straight in to statistics and machine learning. Go download <em><a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a></em> and have a ball.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, let&#8217;s say you have a model, and a has_many relationship to another model. You want to accept nested attributes for the child models in your forms, and you also want to validate that the children must be present; the parent model can&#8217;t be saved unless it has <em>at least one</em> of the child model associated. Easy enough, right?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not too bad. But the thing is, this will validate presence of the children on create, but not on update&#8230;</p>

<p>So, the trouble is (I think), when you save the existing Parent, at the moment validation is checked, there are still children. They won&#8217;t be deleted until .save is called. So the object is valid. Then after it&#8217;s saved, the children have been deleted, and the object is saved, but it is no longer valid. What to do?</p>

<p>Well, after some pondering, I wound up with this (in the update method):</p>

<p>Now, checking for an objects validity in the controller seems wrong to me, too, but it works. Anyone who has run into this find another way to do it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>REDWOOD SHORES &#8211; Oracle is rumored to have lined up yet another in a long string of billion dollar acquisitions, and this time they have set their sights on their very own corporation. No one from Oracle has been willing to make an official statement regarding the rumors, but the news has been spreading throughout Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Oracle, currently worth an estimated 47 billion USD, is a market leader in enterprise software, known particularly for their database product. Industry analysts admit that a corporation buying itself outright is unprecedented, but that, &#8220;As a strategic move, it makes a great deal of sense.&#8221; Enterprise consultant Robert Forsythe comments, &#8220;At this point, there are not a whole lot of other companies for Oracle to acquire. Purchasing themselves provides a creative way around this dilemma. Also, adding Oracle&#8217;s stellar sales staff to their already exhaustive line of software products is sure to be a winning combination.&#8221; Forsythe added, &#8220;I would predict that the shareholders will be happy to hear this rumor confirmed in the near future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not all industry analysts are quite so certain. &#8220;Rumors fly all over Silicon Valley on a regular basis,&#8221; said veteran Valley analyst Pratik Singh. &#8220;This is just the latest in a long line of the same. Could Oracle buy Oracle? Well, sure they could. They certainly have the capital to do so, and are in a better position than anyone else to know the details of Oracle&#8217;s business and strategy. But I fear this will only end up much like last year&#8217;s rumored acquisition of software giant Microsoft, by software giant Microsoft. That had everyone&#8217;s heads turning as well.&#8221; Pratik added, &#8220;Of course, no one in the press bothered to pay attention to the fact that this would have been a terrible acquisition.&#8221;</p>

<p>When questioned about the apparent contradiction inherent to the rumors, Forsythe said, &#8220;Sure, industry outsiders might ask questions like, <em>why would Oracle buy themselves? Don&#8217;t they already own themselves?</em>&#8221; Forsythe paused to allow himself a knowing chuckle. &#8220;But that just betrays a lack of understanding of how things work in the Valley.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, acquisitions in and around Silicon Valley have a long and convoluted history, especially Oracle&#8217;s own long list of corporate purchases. Just last year, Oracle announced a purchase of BEA Software, an announcement which was hastily retracted when it was discovered that Oracle had already purchased BEA Software the previous fiscal year.</p>

<p>Even the skeptical Singh notes, &#8220;Oracle does have some of the brightest business minds in the world on their payroll. It would be irresponsible to assume that they have not considered the possibility of an acquisition of Oracle, by Oracle, and that they would not have made some detailed projections on the possible results of such a transaction. If they believed it would be a positive move for the shareholders, well, of course, every consideration would be made and Oracle would ultimately make the decision that is best for itself, it&#8217;s shareholders and its customers and other stakeholders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regardless of the many and varied opinions put forth by the industry pundits, the rumors continue to gain momentum, and Oracle&#8217;s stock price has indeed jumped several points by close of business yesterday as a result.</p>

<p>Oracle&#8217;s CEO, Larry Ellison, also refused to comment directly on the rumors, saying only, &#8220;I&#8217;m Larry f@#$ing Ellison, I&#8217;ll buy whatever the f@#$ I want to,&#8221; before threatening members of the press corps with disembowelment at the hands of his samurai bodyguards.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/find_x.jpg" alt="" title="find_x" width="394" /><br /></p>

<p>The last couple posts have crossed over into a couple really big topics; one is web application usability, the other is the quality of results returned by an algorithm. They are not the same topic. Anything that can be made more usable should be. The quality of an algorithm&#8217;s results are not necessarily related to that. I started chatting with <a href="http://twitter.com/KuraFire">@Kurafire</a> about this, and he is making some great points&#8230; but I still don&#8217;t precisely agree.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/KuraFire/status/9266841104">The problem with Google&#8217;s algorithm is that a &#8220;mere&#8221; blog could outweigh the second-most visited website on the planet.</a></blockquote>




<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/KuraFire/status/9267865186">My point is that a site&#8217;s traffic rank should be weighed more heavily, certainly when the difference btwn the two is so huge.</a></blockquote>


<p>Let&#8217;s forget the &#8220;Facebook login&#8221; going to ReadWriteWeb rather than Facebook itself, for a moment. Let&#8217;s generalize.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:1.5em;">Question: should an article <em>about</em> a company or entity <em>ever</em> get a higher search ranking than the website of the company or entity itself?</strong></p>

<p>When you phrase it that way, I think the answer is clearly <strong>YES</strong>, there are situations where that could and should happen.</p>

<p>In late 2001, it would make a lot of sense for a search for &#8220;ENRON quarterly earnings&#8221; to point to an article about the accounting scandal rather than simply going straight to an official PDF of their earnings.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s reasonable that a search for &#8220;Amway&#8221; could return an article skeptical of MLMs as high or sometimes higher than the company&#8217;s own site.</p>

<p>Not all the time, and not every time, but there are situations where an article about something could or should get a higher result than the thing itself.</p>

<p>A human being organizing the results might never do that; or they would only do it after it became obvious. Algorithms are dumb. They will just spit out a result based on some sort of process. Sometimes, that&#8217;s better, since it removes our innate bias to how we think things should be ordered. If we try to weight an algorithm too much for the things we innately think should be on top, we could actually be detracting from the value of the algorithm.</p>

<p>Just a thought. I&#8217;m by no means saying that the googorithm can do no wrong, or has no room for improvement. Just that it&#8217;s possible for dumb results to be better than &#8220;smart&#8221; results.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By far the most common and seemingly reasonable objections to my <a href="/2010/02/16/no-were-not-the-stupid-ones">recent post</a> about internet applications and users have been along these lines:</p>

<blockquote style="font-size: 1.5em;">Well, a ReadWriteWeb article about Facebook login is <em>certainly not the same</em> as Facebook&#8217;s actual login page. So if people are looking for Facebook&#8217;s login page, using Google, and are getting to a blog post instead, Google has indeed failed them.</blockquote>


<p>Guys, gals, listen. This sounds very reasonable. It sounds empathetic. It feels right.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 3em;">It&#8217;s wrong.</strong></p>

<p>Stop and think, for a second, what it means to hold the conclusion that Google has failed their users in this case. It would mean, first and foremost, that in an ideal world, <strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">Google should never have returned any other result than the Facebook login page as a response to the query &#8220;facebook login.&#8221;</strong> Okay; <em>if</em> that were true, what does that mean? Either:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Their algorithm is not good enough.</strong> It&#8217;s easy to say this, but let&#8217;s remember that this algorithm that is &#8220;not good enough&#8221; is the same algorithm that catapulted a startup out of nowhere to complete domination in a field (search) that was well saturated by large successful search engines, even in the late 90s; this algorithm that is &#8220;not good enough,&#8221; was nevertheless good enough to pull users away from every other established search engine.

In this case, for an algorithm to be &#8220;good enough&#8221; to anticipate this particular scenario, I think it would basically need to be fully fledged artificially intelligent. So great, good luck with that; have fun on the research staff at the major university of your choosing.

Also, I&#8217;d dare to suggest that if you can come up with a better algorithm, you have a corner office and a stack of VC money with your name on it waiting for you any time you want it, so get cracking.</li>
    <li><strong>Google should have anticipated this and manually set a top search result with the correct site for this query.</strong> It seems that people actually think this; it seems outrageous and unthinkable to me. There&#8217;s no way Google, or any other large service, could anticipate this. I mean, it would be insulting to even suggest it:

<strong>Engineer 1:</strong> Wait&#8230; wait&#8230; what if people are searching for a website login, and they query that? We should make sure that it is returned as the first result. Otherwise they might go to another page and think that they are on their website, and they will be confused that they can&#8217;t log in.
<strong>Engineers 2-999:</strong> Wait, now, the users may not be technical, but they aren&#8217;t <em>that</em> clueless. 
<strong>Engineer 1:</strong> But&#8230;
<strong>Engineers 2-999:</strong> Man, are you ever condescending.
<strong>Engineer 1:</strong> I just&#8230;
<strong>Engineers 2-999:</strong> Why do you hate users so much?
<strong>Engineer 1:</strong> But I&#8217;m just trying to help&#8230;
<strong>Engineers 2-999:</strong> Come on, users are going to <em>know</em> that they are not on the webpage they&#8217;re looking for. It won&#8217;t look the same. It&#8217;ll have a different name. Unless it&#8217;s a deliberate phishing scheme, and we are implementing this to detect and remove those&#8230; 
<em>(long technical discussion about programmatically detecting phishing sites begins)</em>

Seriously, stop and think about it. You would need to be <em>horribly and resolutely cynical</em> about the intelligence level of your users to even suggest, ahead of time, that they (for example) would mistake a blog post from a different website for a web application that they use regularly, possibly daily.

Besides that, there is an unwritten contract implied by Google&#8217;s search listings. The fact that sponsored listings occur (reasonably clearly marked) at the top of the list, implies that the rest of the search results are <em>untampered</em> with. They have been selected based on their relevance to the search query which you supplied. If Google can just select any old result at the top of the list, it completely destroys the credibility of the results.

<em>But wait,</em> you might say. <em>They could do something along the same lines as the &#8220;Did you mean: [this]? that they already attempt to do for common mispellings&#8230;&#8221;</em>.

<br />
<small>Oh, yeah, that *is* what I meant.</small><br />

Yep, they could. And it&#8217;s on this that I will concede, willingly, that perhaps they should try to do something like this in the future.

Where I disagree is the idea that they should have already been doing this; that they should have somehow (magically?) known that this would be necessary. 
</li>
</ol>


<p>So there&#8217;s that. I&#8217;m not saying <strong>&#8220;Screw the users, let them figure it out! Survival of the fittest FTW&#8221;</strong>. Really, I&#8217;m really not. Yes, absolutely, let&#8217;s make changes based on user behavior. Let&#8217;s make things easier to use when we find out they are not easy to use. Let&#8217;s do all those things.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s also say:</p>

<p>It is okay to expect your users to have a basic understanding of the core functionality of your application. In the case of Google, this is not asking very much of the user.</p>

<p><strong>Google:</strong> Okay, here&#8217;s how it works. You type something in the box.
<strong>User:</strong> Okay, I&#8217;m typing.
<strong>Google:</strong> &#8230; and I&#8217;ll try to find anything on the whole entire internet that seems to match what you&#8217;re searching for, and I&#8217;ll give you a list.
<strong>User:</strong> Great, so you&#8217;ll find exactly what I&#8217;m looking for.
<strong>Google:</strong> .Well, not exactly&#8230;. I&#8217;m going to find everything that <em>seems</em> to match, and I&#8217;m going to give you a list, and here&#8217;s the thing, it might be a humongous list&#8230;
<strong>User:</strong> Awesome, so you will find exactly what I&#8217;m looking for.
<strong>Google:</strong> &#8230; well, I&#8217;ll tell you what, I&#8217;m going to put what I <em>think</em> are the most relevant results near to the top of the list, okay, so chances are, hopefully&#8230;
<strong>User:</strong> Hey, that&#8217;s just what I was looking for. Thanks Google!
<strong>Google:</strong> Yes, well. That did work out pretty nicely. Actually, I hope it works that well every time, but you should understand that I&#8217;m just giving you a list of what I <em>think</em> will be the most relevant results, based on your query, and it might&#8230; hello? Hello?</p>

<small>I used to have to log on to the internet uphill, both ways.</small></p>

<p>Listen, I understand that it&#8217;s challenging. I don&#8217;t actually think &#8220;non-technical&#8221; people are &#8220;stupid,&#8221; any more than a tailor would think a programmer was &#8220;stupid&#8221; for being bewildered when sat down in front of a state of the art sewing machine. But if I&#8217;m going to insist on using the sewing machine, the tailor will try to tell me how to use it. If I continue to try to use it incorrectly, the tailor will eventually want to give up on me, unless I&#8217;m able to grasp <em>at least</em> the basic principles of how the thing works.</p>

<p><strong>The Tailor:</strong> <em>Look, it&#8217;s a sewing machine. See, here&#8217;s the bobbin&#8230;</em>
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>I don&#8217;t really want a bobbin, I want thread. Or the needle. I think.</em>
<strong>The Tailor:</strong> <em>The thread is on the bobbin&#8230; and it goes through the needle here&#8230;</em>
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>And I push this pedal now?</em>
<strong>The Tailor:</strong> <em>No, no, not now! Ok, so here is where you set the sort of stitch you want &mdash;</em>
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>I just want to sew these two pieces together. Won&#8217;t it just know what sort of stitch I want?</em>
<strong>The Tailor:</strong> <em>It&#8217;s just a machine, it doesn&#8217;t know anything. So we want this stitch here&#8230;</em>
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>How would I know that? That&#8217;s easy for <u>you</u> to do. Why does this have to be so hard?</em>
<strong>The Tailor:</strong> <em>If you&#8217;d just stop for a minute and learn to use it, it wouldn&#8217;t be that hard&#8230;</em>
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>This all strange and unknown and mysterious and frightening and frustrating. Sewing sucks! The designers of this machine are stupid!</em>
<em>(The Tailor gives up on me and goes to get a beer. I proceed to sew my index finger onto my jeans.)</em></p>

<p>Funkatron, <a href="http://funkatron.com/site/comments/were-the-stupid-ones-facebook-google-and-our-failure-as-developers/">whose post</a> on this contributed to inspiring the original rant, added some points to the end of his post in response; and since he&#8217;s a smart guy, he <em>completely understands</em> the point I was actually making (or attempting to make):</p>

<blockquote>I certainly don’t think that the computer can become (anytime soon) a magic box that determines our whims, nor do I think that people shouldn’t have to learn some things.</blockquote>


<p>This is the point exactly. If we really expect that Google should &#8220;just know&#8221; what we want, we are expecting it to be magical. We are asking for something that belongs to the realm of unicorns and rainbows with pots of gold at the end.</p>

<small>Magic Google Power!</small></p>

<p>At the risk of sounding like an asshole again, <span style="font-size:1.5em;">it&#8217;s called a <strong>search engine</strong>, not a <strong>finding engine</strong>. It cannot read your mind. If you expect it to be able to read your mind, you are stepping outside the bounds of what can reasonably be expected from a machine. The famous button is &#8220;I&#8217;m <strong>feeling lucky</strong>,&#8221; not &#8221;<strong>Take me to exactly the page I&#8217;m thinking about in my brain</strong>.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3>Neither You, Nor Me, Nor Google, Can Read Minds</h3>


<p>I&#8217;m married. Inevitably, my wife will say things or ask things, and lo and behold, <em>the thing that she really wants or means is not exactly the same thing as what she says</em>. Ideally, I would &#8220;just know&#8221; what she <strong>intends</strong> me to get from her comment or question. And while, over time (we&#8217;ve been married 8 1/2 great years), I can become a better guesser, <strong style="font-size:1.3em;">I will never be 100% able to do this because</strong> (surprise) <strong style="font-size:1.3em;">I cannot read minds.</strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the real point: <strong style="font-size:1.5em;">if I view myself as a failure because of my inability to read minds, I am setting myself up for misery. It is not reasonable to set <em>impossible tasks</em> as<em> criteria for success</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Really, if that one thing is not communicated in these most recent two posts, then I&#8217;m just not going to be able to communicate it. Expecting Google (or any software) to &#8220;know,&#8221; with certainty, my intentions, is completely absurd. And with that in mind, there is no way to call this a failure on the part of Google.</p>

<p>Ed goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>What I do think is that the current interface modern OSes on computers provide is simply overwhelming for most users, to the point that it’s very challenging to learn how to accomplish tasks without a very significant investment of time.</blockquote>


<p>Look, here I agree completely. I have agreed with this the whole time. I&#8217;m a huge supporter of user testing, of good UX design, and of changing things based on user feedback.</p>

<p>In fact, I&#8217;m probably just being a bit pedantic to be stuck on this one, single atom of disagreement, that is, the idea that Google or developers generally have &#8220;failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another example. When you go to a gas station to fill up your car (here in the US, at least), you can usually use a credit card at the pump to pay for your gas. A credit card has a magnetic stripe on one edge of one side of the card. So because I can flip a credit card upside down or front to back, there are four ways I can put the card into the slot, and only one way that the machine can read the magnetic stripe. Now, there is (almost) always a handy diagram showing you how you&#8217;re supposed to put the card into the machine. But people do it wrong all the time. Because the part of the card reader that reads the stripe is usually clear, there are normally only two obvious ways to insert the card: stripe up facing left, or stripe up facing right.</p>

<p>Now, at some point, some wonderful person who designs these machines said, <em>You know what? People are always putting their card in the wrong way. It would be really trivial to just put a magnetic stripe reader on both sides, and then as long as the stripe is at the top, it is impossible to insert the card incorrectly.</em> And they implemented it, and it seems to be standard on most new gas pumps.</p>

<p>Is the new design, where it is (almost) impossible to run your card incorrectly, better? Absolutely it is. It&#8217;s improved.</p>

<p><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/credit_card_swipe.jpg" alt="" title="credit_card_swipe" width="455" height="350" /><br />
<small>Hey, now that&#8217;s pretty handy.</small></p>

<p>Was the old design wrong? Was it a failure on the part of the gas pump card reader designers? I&#8217;m going to say <strong>no</strong>. It wasn&#8217;t wrong. It did what it was supposed to do, and asked only that the user glance at the diagram to know which way to put the stripe in to the card reader. There was room for improvement, and it was indeed improved, but it was not &#8220;wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve Krug&#8217;s disciples might now be saying, <em>The old design <strong>requires</strong> you to think, so it <strong>is</strong> failing! Don&#8217;t make people think!&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Steve Krug&#8217;s work is great, and I agree completely with the &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321344758?ie=UTF8&tag=idepermin-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321344758">Don&#8217;t Make Me Think</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=idepermin-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321344758" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />&#8221; mantra. But there comes a point, with anything, at which people must make a decision, and <strong>we have to assume that people will demonstrate some common sense</strong>.</p>

<p>So you can only take that so far.</p>

<p>If I want to sew, I can argue all day that sewing machines should be easier to use, and hey &mdash; maybe we can still come up with ways to improve their usability. But sooner or later, I need to accept that <strong>I must learn to use a sewing machine in order to get the results that I want</strong>. The responsibility is mine. It is not the sewing machine&#8217;s fault if I can&#8217;t stitch two things together.</p>

<p>And if I blame the sewing machine, <strong>I&#8217;m wrong</strong>.</p>
