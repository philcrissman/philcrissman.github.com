</h1>


	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>More from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Sim">Dave Sim</a>, this time from the <a href="http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/nftp/185.php">Note from the President in #185</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Self-publishing does not just happen. Even if I put everything that I know about self-publishing into a single volume and mailed a copy free to everyone who wrote in asking for advice, self-publishing would not just happen. One of the biggest obstacles you are going to face in trying to self-publish is your own inertia. Jeff Smith&#8217;s standard advice is to &#8216;do your homework&#8217;. By this he means that you should find out everything about publishing and distribution before you even attempt to enter the field. &#8216;Doing your homework&#8217; is very different, however, from the traditional view of that phrase, which has come to mean (in the last half of the twentieth century) send a list of thirty-five questions to an expert and then sit back and wait for a reply.</p>

<p>Understand this:</p>

<p>Not only doesn&#8217;t the world revolve around you, NOTHING revolves around you. You are a human being. Picture yourself as a planet. Your talent, your intended comic book, your story-to-be is your molten core. It is up to you to make an environment for that molten core which is conducive to growth, which will permit your talent to flourish in a hostile world. There are any number of ways to go about this. I always recommend that the story has to come first. You have to have something to say. The only way to find out if you have something to say and the determination and work ethic to see it through to its conclusion is to make a start and stick with it. I find, at this point, that most would-be self-publishers&#8217; eyes start to glaze over.</p>

<p>SNAP SNAP.</p>

<p>WAKE UP!</p></blockquote>

<p>Love this. For years before I left Full Time Employment and went freelance, I would always look at anyone who was self-employed, or a contractor, or working freelance, and be a little jealous, and I would want to ask them <em>how do you do that?</em>, by which I really meant, <em>how can I do that?</em> Invariably, I wasn&#8217;t happy with the answer(s) I recieved. I always felt like there was some sort of magic dust that I was missing which would help me to suddenly &#8220;go freelance&#8221;.</p>

<p>What the &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; actually turned out to be was to just <em>quit</em> a full time IT role at Oracle in exchange for a 3-month contract at a pretty low freelancing rate, because honestly, I really had no idea what I was doing at that point.</p>

<p><em>3 months?</em></p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p><em>But what did you plan to do after 3 months?</em></p>

<p>I had no idea. It turned out that the initial 3 months turned into 6 months, after which I was able to go do some work for a different local developer, and so on. In retrospect, I was incredibly fortunate. But I also would never have experienced that &#8220;good fortune&#8221; without just making a start, essentially jumping without a net. I&#8217;m still not sure how my wife dealt with the stress of my taking that leap. It&#8217;s worked out fine&mdash;better than we could have predicted, really, as I&#8217;ve been able to raise my rates substantially over the past 4+ years, and we&#8217;re now doing far better, financially, than if I had just kept my safe corporate job. My first freelancing contract was essentially a paid internship in Ruby on Rails and independent consulting and I&#8217;ll be forever grateful that I had that opportunity.</p>

<p>But there was certainly no way to predict that when I took the leap.</p>

<p>When I think about it now, it seems like one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve ever made. But prior to that, all my thinking and wishing about &#8220;going independent&#8221; was pretty much exactly what Dave Sim describes in the arena of self-publishing; I was hoping to find some nugget of knowledge, some magic step that would cause my indepence to &#8220;just happen&#8221;.</p>

<p>Nothing &#8220;just happens&#8221;.</p>

<p>Except maybe entropy.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I create yet another of these, I felt like I should probably call these &#8220;summaries&#8221; rather than &#8220;reviews&#8221;. These are not &#8220;reviews&#8221; of <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a> episodes; the &#8220;review&#8221; is, they are awesome and you should go subscribe to the podcasts at once.</p>

<h2><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/2">Picture of a Boat</a></h2>

<p><strong>Running time:</strong> 1:08:02</p>

<p><strong>Pairs well with:</strong> A dreamcatcher, some ambition, and a picture of a boat. (Dreamcatcher and picture of a boat are optional)</p>

<p>Dan and Merlin talk about dreams which cannot be interpreted on the air. Probably a sex thing.</p>

<p>The possibly canonical cognitive bias is revealed: that other people are stupid and mean, and I have my reasons.</p>

<p>On how Merlin is rarely rehired by companies because he often winds up telling them that the people who hired him are a big part of the problem.</p>

<p>Some chatting about the standard corporate rhetoric on innovation. Everyone wants you to innovate. But it&#8217;s not really a verb. There&#8217;s no &#8220;innovate&#8221; button on Merlin&#8217;s keyboard. If you really want innovation, you need to tolerate the sort if chaos and failure rate that often typifies environments where innovation happens.</p>

<p>Paraphrase: if you really did want innovation everywhere you need to encourage ambitious and crazy efforts that will probably fail.</p>

<p>On genetics: if your company culture doesn&#8217;t foster this sort of thing, that&#8217;s sort of like DNA and its going to be really hard to change. Find the little group in your company that ships the most interesting stuff and find out what it is about their team that makes them able to do that, an try to replicate the <em>spirit</em> that makes that possible. What do they not see as barriers that everyone else sees?</p>

<p>On empowerment: it&#8217;s a shame this concept even has to exist, it&#8217;s a shame people need to ask permission to be awesome.</p>

<p>Dand and Merlin talk about how many people tend to be conservative at work; not wanting to lose job, rock boat, not want to be the guy who came up with The Thing That Just Failed, everyone wants buy in from everyone else.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='The way you become CEO isn&#8217;t by showing up on time, you become CEO by being so great that the person 1-3 levels above you can&#8217;t keep you from being promoted over them.'>
Maybe you&#8217;re in a place with more mortar than brick. Maybe you aren&#8217;t expected to innovate. So then what? Go ship anyways. The way you become CEO isn&#8217;t by showing up on time, you become CEO by being so great that the person 1-3 levels above you can&#8217;t keep you from being promoted over them.
</span></p>

<p>What are you willing to sacrifice for that thing you care a lot about? Ego. Always being right. If you can&#8217;t take the trade off, then&#8230; You pretty much just need to move on (ie give up)</p>

<p>Stuff about <a href="http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/">Path Finder</a> (app, Mac finder replacement).</p>

<hr />

<p>Great episode. Go thou and do likewise.</p>

</h1>


	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/images/posts/cerebus168cover.jpg" alt="Cerebus 168" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been re-reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark">Cerebus the Aardvark</a> in its entirety; started at issue number 1 a few weeks ago. As I&#8217;ve gone through the issues, I&#8217;ve been reading Dave Sim&#8217;s <em>Notes from the President</em> column. In issue 168, he begins talking about <a href="http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/nftp/168.php">the issue of self-publishing comic books</a>, and I was struck by how his first column on the topic contains advice that is really germane to almost <em>anything</em> that you want to do, but that you don&#8217;t yet know how to do.</p>

<blockquote><p>When young cartoonists ask me how to self-publish, I always liken it to a golf fan going up to Lee Trevino and asking &#8216;How do I become a professional golfer?&#8217; The answer of course is a question. &#8216;Do you have a set of golf clubs?&#8217; Here, let me write that down. Buy a set of golf clubs. And then a second question &#8216;Have you ever played golf?&#8217; Okay, that&#8217;s good. Let me write that down, too. Play some golf. Do you understand? Writing and drawing comic books is like anything else. You have to apply yourself and you have to do it. Assuming I wanted to be Eric Clapton when I grow up (or at least when I&#8217;m older), it makes a great deal of sense for me to buy a guitar and take some lessons before I write and ask him how to become like him. You first have to find out if you have the aptitude for what you&#8217;re attempting to do. Now, the only way that you are going to discover that is to sit down and try to do it. The guideline I always use is A Page a Day. If you can&#8217;t comfortably do a finished comic book page (written, pencilled, inked, lettered and toned) in a single day, you are facing trouble before you get very far along. Assuming that you are going to draw a comic book every month and making allowances for the way that life intrudes despite the best of creative intentions, a page a day is mandatory if you&#8217;re going to stay on your monthly schedule. If it takes you two or three days to do a page, the best that you&#8217;re going to manage is bi-monthly and if two or three days is the best you can manage and most of the time if takes you four or five days, then you are looking at quarterly as the maximum frequency. When you consider that the average black and white comic book is going to sell two or three thousand copies and the profits from that are going to be around two or three hundred dollars, that gives you a total income of seventy-five dollars a month for all of your living expenses. Even the most widely-known and well-thought of black and whites are selling in the low ten to twelve thousand range. It is not a get-rich quick scheme. The first five years that I did Cerebus I could have made more money baby-sitting (that isn&#8217;t a joke). Five years. Think about it.</p>

<p>But, I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself.</p>

<hr />

<p>The most common mistake of the starting cartoonist who wants to self-publish is to ask questions about things that are two or three years down the line. How do I copyright my character? How do I find a printer? How do I solicit the distributors? How much should I advertise? What you are doing is asking Lee Trevino (having already established that you don&#8217;t even own a set of golf clubs) what the best airline is to travel from tournament to tournament: how much caddies get paid; what sort of wood to use on the fifth hole at whatever course.</p>

<p>Go to the bank, take out some money, and buy yourself a club.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know, it&#8217;s ostensibly about making an independent comic book. Again, I think the core of the above advice applies to almost anything you want to do.</p>

</h1>


	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I never used to listen to podcasts.</p>

<p>That ever so slight barrier to entry, the friction of having to actually subscribe to an RSS feed and take the time to plug in to iTunes or transfer things to a phone, always was just enough friction to stop me from bothering. That and the huge variety of available podcasts (even several years back, it seemed like there were innumerable podcasts out there), and <em>no idea</em> how to evaluate what I would want to listen to.</p>

<p>My friend Todd Emmel of <a href="http://slantwiselabs.com">Slantwise Labs</a>, who I was working for at the time, had started listening to a new show called &#8221;<a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to work</a>&#8221;, and asked me if I&#8217;d listened to it, or was aware of it. &#8220;Why, no,&#8221; I said. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s this new podcast that Merlin Mann is doing,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>So, I knew exactly 3 things about Merlin Mann at that point. I knew he was behind <a href="http://43folders.com">43 Folders</a>, which I had not really heard of or read until about the time he stopped publishing regularly on it; I knew he was behind <a href="http://5ives.com">5ives</a>, which I thought was awesome and which had also stopped being updated; and I knew he had something to do with <a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com">You look nice today</a>, which I had heard wonderful things about and which I had never taken the time to listen to. And which had also stopped being updated.</p>

<p>So, Todd said this &#8220;Back to work&#8221; was really good. So I took the time to overcome the minimal friction between finding a podcast and actually listening to it, and downloaded the first handful of episodes (I think there were only 3 or 4 episodes published at the time).</p>

<p>Long story short, I&#8217;ve now been a listener for the past year+, and also listen to a handful of other podcasts, mostly also <a href="http://5by5.tv">5 by 5</a> podcasts, because they&#8217;re great.</p>

<p>Just because, I recently decided to go back and re-listen to all the B2W episodes. Unlike many podcasts which may focus, at least in part, on current events, B2W&#8217;s topics are generally contextless, which lends <em>very</em> well to relistenability. So this is the first of (possibly many) reviews of historical B2W episodes.</p>

<h2><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/1">The Alligator in the Bathroom</a></h2>

<p><strong>B2W S01E01</strong></p>

<p>Running time: 1:29:28</p>

<p><em>In which the genesis and premise of the show are discussed at length, and we are promised that Merlin intends to do more than 3 episodes. Also, Florida, San Francisco, kids, Buddhism, and ADHD.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pairs well with:</strong> 32oz of black coffee and 30mg of generic Adderall.</p>

<p>Still an episode worth a listen (or re-listen), despite the &#8220;sticking our heads up each others ass and saying how nice it smells&#8221; (Merlin&#8217;s phrase). It does, I thought, help to establish the context of how and why the show began and what both Merlin and Dan hope to get out of it, the &#8220;goals&#8221; and general topics of the show.</p>

<p>A phrase that came up was something along the lines of, &#8220;trying to become good enough that the people you really admire wouldn&#8217;t mind working on something with you.&#8221; Which is something that I had really never thought of, and did make me stop and think.</p>

<p>Another sort of blindingly obvious but still helpful, for me, observation, was the simple statement that if you want to mow your lawn, you can&#8217;t go to the movies. I.E., you really can only do a limited amount of things, and in order to to the things you really want, you&#8217;re going to need to choose the things that you don&#8217;t do. Leading up to: the higher up you go, the more opportunity you have to disappoint more interesting people.</p>

<p>Related takeaway: speaking of distraction; consider that if you have time to masturbate (assuming you have time for that), or to play video games, or to pick up your zombies on Facebook, you&#8217;re not really distracted. Selah.</p>

<p><strong>Notable:</strong> The phrase, &#8220;It&#8217;s your show&#8221; makes its first appearance right here in E01, albeit without the sharp passive aggressive undertone (or overtone) which it acquires later in the shows run. Also, &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Merlin&#8221; guy shows up, though I don&#8217;t think that precise phrase is used in this episode.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://brettterpstra.com">Brett Terpstra</a> is referenced. But without the enaging, idiosyncratic pronounciation of his last name.</p>

<p>B2W E01. If you have never listened, it&#8217;s worthwhile to start right at the beginning.</p>
