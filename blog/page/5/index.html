<blockquote>Unit testing, in particular, is designed to reel in spontaneous hacking. It is like framing a picture before it has been painted.

No, let&#8217;s not have rules. I don&#8217;t feel comfortable with having coding standards or any protocol on Camping. The point of Camping is to have very ugly, tricky code that goes against all the rules that people make for &#8220;beautiful&#8221; code these days. To show that ugly code can do beautiful things, maybe.

I don&#8217;t want to demonize anyone here, I just want to express the ideas that make Camping different. Camping&#8217;s personality is 80x50. It is like the little gears of a watch that are all meshed together into a tight little mind-bending machine. The challenge of Camping isn&#8217;t to figure out how to automate obfuscation. The challenge is to bring new tricks into the code that push Ruby&#8217;s parser and make everyone look twice. Not all code needs to be a factory, some of it can just be origami.

<p>I&#8217;ve recently started digging into script/console a little deeper. As a tool for Rails development, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that words like &#8220;indispensable&#8221; come to mind when the topic of the console arises. That said, I&#8217;ve yet to see a really complete guide to using script/console &#8211; lots and lots of collections of tips and tricks, but never a good solid guide to what&#8217;s going on with script/console.</p>

<p>This is the first of what will hopefully be several posts about what&#8217;s really going on when you open the rails console.</p>

<p>If we look at just the console script, we&#8217;ll find just these three lines:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>script/console  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dirname</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">__FILE__</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/../config/boot&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;commands/plugin&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first line is simply the shebang line that lets the file be an executable ruby script. The second line requires the file config/boot. This file is a little over a hundred lines by default, so we won&#8217;t reproduce it here; you can read it quickly (if you want to) in one of your own rails projects. It basically sets some load paths and some constants, and ends by booting rails with <code>Rails.boot!</code>.</p>

<p>The third line requires <code>commands/console</code>&#8230; and that&#8217;s it. So to see what&#8217;s actually happening, we&#8217;ll have to look there.</p>

<p>You can find <code>commands/console.rb</code> in <code>railties/lib</code> in your rails directory, in <code>vendor</code> if you have frozen rails to a specific version, or otherwise under your rails gem in the lib directory.</p>

<p>(e.g., on this machine it&#8217;s in
 /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rails/lib/commands/console.rb).</p>

<p><code>console.rb</code> looks like this:</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a fair bit in there, so let&#8217;s look at what it&#8217;s doing in detail.</p>

<p>Line 1 is setting a local variable named <code>irb</code>. It checks to see if the constant <code>RAILS_PLATFORM</code> matches a value that would indicate we&#8217;re using some flavor of Microsoft Windows; if we are, it sets <code>irb</code> to <code>irb.bat</code>, which is what irb will be named for a Windows build of ruby; otherwise it&#8217;s set to simply <code>irb</code>, which is the commands name on *nix systems, including Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Next it requires &#8216;optparse&#8217;. <code>optparse</code> is a Ruby library for parsing options (I imagine you guessed that).</p>

<p>Then a local variable named <code>options</code> is created, and is given a few default parameters: <code>:sandbox</code> is set to false (more on this in a moment), and <code>:irb</code> is set to the local variable irb (in other words, to either &#8216;irb.bat&#8217; or &#8216;irb&#8217;, depending on the result of the expression on line 1).</p>

<p>An <code>OptionsParser</code> object is created next. We won&#8217;t dive into the details of this, but you&#8217;ll note a striking similarity to what you see in this block and what you&#8217;ll see if you type <code>script/console -h</code> in your rails root.</p>

<p>So if we follow along, we&#8217;ll read about the three standard command line arguments we can use when firing up the console:</p>

<p><code>--sandbox</code>, which just adds the feature that any changes you make to the database will be undone at the end of your console session
<code>--irb</code>, which allows you to choose a different version of irb if applicable; so, if you have Ruby 1.9 installed, but not set as your default ruby version, you could start up the console with <code>script/console --irb=irb1.9</code>, and see how your console experiments work with Ruby 1.9.
<code>--debugger</code>, which enables ruby debugging.</p>

<p>Next a local variable named <code>libs</code> is created; it&#8217;s a string, and a number of lines are concatenated to it, each in the form &#8221; -r [some library or module]&#8221;. The libs variable is eventually going to be passed to irb when the console starts it; the -r switch to irb simple requires whatever the next argument is. So this is simply building a list of the modules and libraries which are going to be present when the console is fired up.</p>

<p>The next section handles the case where you have actually typed <code>script/console --debugger</code>; it tries to require ruby-debug, and if an exception is raised, it will helpfully suggest that you run <code>gem install ruby-debug</code>.</p>

<p>On line 31, console sets the environment; it looks at your first argument to see if you tried to specify an environment, and if not, sets it to either <code>ARGV.first</code> (the first argument, if applicable), <code>ENV['RAILS_ENV']</code> (whatever the environment is already set to), or as a last resort to &#8217;<code>development</code>&#8217; (which is probably what you want, most of the time, hence why you may only rarely use this feature).</p>

<p>If you try this by typing <code>script/console foo</code>, you&#8217;ll see that console will try (and fail, unless you&#8217;ve created a foo environment) to find the file <code>/config/environments/foo.rb</code>. So as long as the environment you specify exists, the console will use it.</p>

<p>Now, since it&#8217;s using <code>ARGV.first</code>, you might ask yourself why, if you type <code>script/console --sandbox</code>, the console does not try to load the &#8221;<code>--sandbox</code>&#8221; environment. Good question! The answer can be found up in line 11: <code>opt.parse!(ARGV)</code>. The <code>parse!</code> method parses destructively; it pulls any valid options out of <code>ARGV</code>, and then returns whatever&#8217;s left over. So if <code>ARGV</code> started out as <code>"test --sandbox --irb=irb1.9"</code>, after <code>opts.parse!(ARGV)</code> it will just equal <code>"test"</code>. If nothing but valid options were supplied (i.e., no attempt to specify an environment), ARGV would be an empty string, and the environment will be set to either <code>ENV['RAILS_ENV'</code>], if it exists, or to &#8216;development&#8217; if it doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>So now console&#8217;s figured out which environment to use, it checks to see if you&#8217;ve specified the sandbox option, and if you have, it prints a friendly message to remind you that anything you do to the database will be undone when you exit the console.</p>

<p>But wait, you might say. Other than print a message, it doesn&#8217;t do anything; what actually makes the sandbox/database rollback work? Good question. If you look back up at lines 14-18, where the libs variable is set, you&#8217;ll note that <code>console_sandbox</code> is required, but <em>only if</em> <code>options[:sandbox]</code> returns true. <code>console_sandbox</code> will take care of all that database rollback headache for us; so that&#8217;s where it will come from.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s only one line left: an <code>exec</code> expression. exec is going to execute the string you pass to it on the command line. So a plain vanilla run of script/console is actually running:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>irb -r irb/completion -r ~/your_rails_project_path/config/environment -r console_app -r console_with_helpers --simple_prompt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you really want to, you could just type all that every time you want to use the console, but I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;ll stick with script/console.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking there must be a little more to it than this, you&#8217;re right; you&#8217;ll remember that when <code>libs</code> was created, the modules <code>console_app</code> and <code>console_with_helpers</code> were required. That may be what I write about next, but in the meantime, if you have Rails installed you can always just open those files up and see what&#8217;s in them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xiaming/99206245/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/30/99206245_862bc5c93d.jpg?v=0" /></a>

<p>One of the hallmarks of object oriented programming in most every implementation of it that I know of is the ability to designate certain methods as &#8220;private&#8221; or &#8220;protected&#8221;, thus keeping them from being called willy-nilly by any old script that wants to call them. Ruby also has this, of course, but interestingly enough it can be easily circumvented.</p>

<p>I guess there are a few posts floating around about it, but I discovered it by accident playing around in irb this evening. I was reading David A. Black&#8217;s The Well Grounded Rubyist, where he mentions that you could send a message to a class either within the class definition itself, or by simply sending it to the class object like you&#8217;d send any other message:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># The normal way to do it</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Thing</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">message</span> <span class="ss">:whatever</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># you could also do this</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:whatever</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>David mention&#8217;s attr_accessor in this context, so I thought I&#8217;d try that. Open <code>irb</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Thing</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sc">?&gt;</span> <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="no">Thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">attr_accessor</span> <span class="ss">:name</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">NoMethodError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">private</span> <span class="nb">method</span> <span class="s1">&#39;attr_accessor&#39;</span> <span class="n">called</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="no">Thing</span><span class="ss">:Class</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Oh. So much for that, then. But, knowing of the existence of the send method, I thought I&#8217;d try that.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:attr_accessor</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For the non-<code>irb</code> user, that <code>nil</code> that was returned, and the fact that no error message was returned, indicated that our experiment worked. Now <code>Thing</code>&#8217;s have a name attribute.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Larry&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Larry&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Larry&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What&#8217;s interesting about all this is that <code>attr_accessor</code> is a private method on <code>Class</code>. Yet we just called it.</p>

<p><code>send</code> is often introduced as a way to show how everything is an object and that you can do exciting things like <code>1.send(:+, 1)</code> and get <code>2</code> as the result. No one usually mentions that it can be used to call private or protected methods from outside a given class.</p>

<p>To make it clear what you could do here:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>So, yes. You can do this, if you so choose. Please use your powers for good, and not for evil.</p>

<p>Now <em>why</em> this works, I can&#8217;t yet say, though I&#8217;m interested in learning, if there is a reason. Evidently there <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/7404">may have been some debate</a> as to whether ruby 1.9 would still have this behavior, but as of this writing it does.</p>

<p>Note: I did only a brief search, and it seems <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=ruby+send+method&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">this functionality is not unknown</a>, though it still seems somewhat odd to me that such an easy way to sidestep the private/protected designation of methods exists.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You&#8217;re being a Good Software developer and diligently testing all your code, and lo and behold, you get this result to one of your tests:</p>

<p>An annoying problem with floats that might look and for all practical purposes be equal, but internally as stored by the computer are not <em>precisely</em> equal.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re probably using:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">assert_equal</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a_value_expected_to_be_1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Instead, use:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">assert_in_delta</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a_value_expected_to_be_1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mo">000001</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Though, you may also want to ask yourself if you really need to be using floating point numbers; but assuming that you <em>do</em> need them, <code>assert_in_delta</code> will compensate for the annoying fact that floating point numbers might not actually be precisely what you expect them to be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just figured out a test on which I spent far too long wondering why it wasn&#8217;t working. I kept coming back to it and trying something else, and it kept not working.</p>

<p>We have a form which submits to a create action by a remote_form_for; so, an Ajax request, in other words. The controller action just uses <code>render :update</code> and replaces some HTML instead of redirecting. But in every other respect, it&#8217;s a POST to the controller, and is going to call :create. Easy, right?</p>

<p>We&#8217;re using shoulda, and despite having a perfectly reasonable <code>post :create, :whatever_id => @thing.id, :our_model => { :stuff => "stuff" }</code> in the setup, it wasn&#8217;t actually creating the item; shoulda&#8217;s handy <code>should_change "Thing.count", :by => 1</code> kept failing.</p>

<p>I finally just started flipping through The Literature (in this case, the Rails Way&#8217;s chapter on testing), and happened to notice an off-hand remark that, in addition to methods for POST, PUT, GET, etc, there was an <code>xhr</code> method, to simulate an XMHHttpRequest.</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>What I should have been writing, all along, was:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My wife has gone to Thailand for two weeks. So I&#8217;m on my own.</p>

<p>I am, as they say, &#8220;batching it&#8221; for a couple weeks. This is usually understood to mean that I will wear the same underwear for two weeks, eat nothing but junk food, abandon cleaning the house, and play video games all night.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t working out so well.</p>

<p>The video game thing isn&#8217;t happening. I look at my X-box (old one, not a 360) and think, <em>I could sit and play something for&#8230; for, well for hours.</em> But then I think, <em>But I&#8217;ve finished all the games I own. And I don&#8217;t really feel like replaying them yet, and I could go get a new used game, but I can&#8217;t think of anything I&#8217;d want to own, and really, is that responsible?</em></p>

<p>I tried to leave the dishes in the sink. Normally this is no problem. This week I keep looking at them and thinking, <em>Sheesh, it&#8217;s only going to take five more seconds to put it in the dishwasher.</em> And the next thing I know, it&#8217;s in the dishwasher.</p>

<p>I bought a huge bag of potato chips when I went grocery shopping. They are still sitting unopened on the kitchen table. Every time I look at them, I think, <em>Those sound good, but I should really eat some real food. Those aren&#8217;t very good for me.</em></p>

<p>I have a strange compulsion to vacuum the rug. I can&#8217;t explain it, it&#8217;s just there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried leaving my clothes on the floor when I change, but it just throws the whole room off. I have to put them in the hamper.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m beginning to think that I am no longer a very good bachelor.</p>

<p>Oh, I can talk the talk. I can say I&#8217;ll eat cereal two meals a day, shower &#8220;later,&#8221; and stay up till 3am. Except that there are some leftovers to eat, and that sounds a little better. Or maybe pasta. Or a roast. With some potatoes and broccoli. And I will feel a lot better if I have a shower, and 3am&#8230; man, I need to get up early, I can&#8217;t do that.</p>

<p>So far, I have not shaved my face. I am counting that as a point for the &#8220;batching it&#8221; score.</p>

<p>But for now, I should get back to work. And if I&#8217;m not going to open those potato chips, I think I should really take them off the kitchen table and put them in the pantry.</p>

<time datetime="2009-01-14T00:00:00-06:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 14<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hold strong opinions about the placement of curly braces.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t care where K &amp; R put them, I&#8217;ll put them wherever I want to put them. And don&#8217;t even start with the CSS files with the closing curly brace indented inline with the rules. Where did that come from?</p>

<p>It appears that I also hold strong opinions about indentation. Also, on whether or not a space should be left on the inside of opening and closing delimiters before the argument(s) they contain, where such delimiters are optional, whether or not they should be used, and whether or not text should wrap in the source listing, .</p>

<p>I have strong opinions about choices of languages to use for programming. Although I will concede, probably grudgingly, that there are other languages which may be faster, more elegant, more efficient, or more popular than my favorite language(s), this will not alter my preference, and if pressed I will defend my language regardless of its perceived shortcomings. If nothing else, I will claim that my language is more fun, or some other reason for its superiority which has nothing to do with programming languages <em>per se</em>. Furthermore, I will not accept the use of these same arguments if used to show that a different language is somehow superior to my favorite language or languages.</p>

<p>I have a great respect for people who understand topics or concepts which I do not understand yet, but which I nevertheless place on a pedestal as pinnacles of programming wisdom.</p>

<p>I have deeply held convictions about text editors. Really, it&#8217;s better not to talk about it. Just walk away.</p>

<p>I am strongly attached to the frameworks and libraries which I approve of, and repulsed by the ones of which I do not approve. Large libraries which I like are <em>multifaceted</em>, while the ones which I do not like are <em>bloated</em>. Small libraries which I like are <em>elegant and efficient</em>, while those which I do not like are <em>incomplete or trivial</em>.</p>

<p>I have strong opinions about Operating Systems. People who are not using my favorite Operating System would be far more productive if they would simply &#8220;wake up&#8221; and get &#8220;real computers&#8221;. Brilliant people whom I respect but who nevertheless use other Operating Systems are exempt.</p>

<p>We should talk about indentation some more. I hold opinions on whether said indentations should use spaces or tabs, and how many spaces they should use. They are only opinions. However, if you do not share them, you are probably wrong.</p>

<p>When there is more than one way to do something, I will have an opinion on which is the best way to do it. This opinion is correct, although I may tell you that your way of doing it is fine also. <em>I am just being nice. Your way is retarded, slow, inefficient, insufficiently clever, unmaintainable, obfuscated or deprecated, pick two.</em></p>

<p>I have opinions about software development methodologies. These opinions cover project management styles, agile methodologies, artifacts, modeling languages, and best practices. Projects which fail to do well invariably failed because they neglected an area which I feel very strongly about, and will describe to you in great detail if you show a sign you are interested.</p>

<p>I am deeply attached to my preferred tool for source control management, which is better than your preferred tool for source control management, unless you happen to prefer the same one, in which case you are correct.</p>

<p>I have a favorite computer acronym, a favorite obsolete piece of hardware, a favorite programming anecdote, joke, historical event, and aphorism. I have a favorite algorithm, meme, binary operator, ascii character and UTF entity. I have a favorite NP Complete problem, which is more interesting than your favorite NP Complete problem, even though they can both be shown to be reducible to a common problem, or even to each other.</p>

<p>Despite my not yet having designed or created a killer app, I am convinced that I know why other apps have failed, and will not hesitate to share this knowledge if prompted. Despite having not run a multi-million dollar technology company, I know exactly what is wrong with the companies which are out there, and how they could be fixed.</p>

<p>Just don&#8217;t ask me about politics or religion, now; I prefer not to be argumentative on the internet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I certainly can&#8217;t claim to have <em>discovered</em> these tips; but they&#8217;ve been pretty helpful to me. Maybe this will just make them a little easier to find for whoever is looking for them next.</p>

<h3>Getting A Collection&#8217;s Index From Within a Partial</h3>


<p>Lets say you&#8217;re passing a collection to a partial, but that somewhere in that partial you are interested in knowing which index you&#8217;re at. Do you need to implement a counter? Nope; there already is one. A collection passed to a partial implicitly creates a counter called <code>[partial_name]_counter</code>. So, if you called with</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='rb'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="sx">%= render :partial =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;thing&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:collection</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="vi">@a_few_of_my_favorite_things</span> <span class="o">%&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>then in your partial, you could use:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="o">%=</span> <span class="n">thing_counter</span> <span class="o">%&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>to return the index as you plow through the collection. Life is good. Rails is looking out for you. (Hat tip to <a href="http://gmarik.blogspot.com/2007/09/rails-collection-index-within-partial.html">GMarik</a>, which is where I saw this one.)</p>

<h3>Obtaining a Class name From a String</h3>


<p>Today I found myself wanting to take a string, let&#8217;s say <code>"Thing"</code>, and use it as a class name, <code>Thing</code>. Again, it turns out this can be done. In Ruby, class names are constants, so you can do</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">str</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Thing&quot;</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; &quot;Thing&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Kernel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">const_get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; Thing</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Hooray!</p>

<h3>Make Finding Easier</h3>


<p>Find yourself writing long, complicated find expressions in your code? There is a better way.</p>

<p>Perhaps in your code&#8230; maybe even in a view&#8230; maybe you want to find all <code>Things</code> that don&#8217;t belong to the current use, and which are flagged with some property, and you&#8217;re temped to write something like:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:all</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:conditions</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;user != ? and flag = true&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">current_user</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What we could do is put some <code>has_finder</code>s in the Thing model, something like</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Thing</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">has_finder</span> <span class="ss">:exclude_user</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:conditions</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;things.user_id != </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">has_finder</span> <span class="ss">:with_flag</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:conditions</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;things.flag = true&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Having done that, you could now replace that first bit with:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:all</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">with_flag</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exclude_user</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">current_user</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&#8217;s a little shorter, sure, but more importantly, when you read it, it just makes more sense. A completely new person coming to look at this line would have a good idea what it was doing without even looking in the model to see what the <code>has_finder</code>s were doing.</p>

<h3>Okay then</h3>


<p>If you&#8217;ve spent any amount of time using rails, these probably aren&#8217;t new to you. Everything&#8217;s new at least <em>once</em>, though, so hopefully these are helpful to someone.</p>

<time datetime="2008-05-09T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 9<span>th</span>, 2008</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used a little jQuery last night to clear some form fields. The basic idea was, there were a couple text inputs in the form for first and last name; rather than label the fields, I made the value of each form to be initially &#8220;First&#8221; and &#8220;Last&#8221; respectively.</p>

<p>Then I was requested to make it so that when the field was clicked on, the word &#8220;First&#8221; or &#8220;Last&#8221; (respectively) would disappear, so that you could then proceed to enter a value without needing to highlight and delete the existing value of the text field.</p>

<p>It turns out that with jQuery, this is simple enough; let&#8217;s assume your field has the class &#8220;clearme&#8221;:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">ready</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.clearme&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">focus</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">val</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with jQuery, you know that the wrapper <code>$(document).ready()</code> simply waits until the page is finished loading, then executes the function you&#8217;ve passed to it. In this case, the function passed looks for an item of the class &#8220;clearme&#8221; and waits for that element to receive focus. When it does, it changes the value to &#8220;&#8221;.</p>

<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-6000752616661499";
/* clear-jquery */
google_ad_slot = "4377662715";
google_ad_width = 300;
google_ad_height = 250;
//-->
</script>


<script type="text/javascript"
src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script>


<p>Simple enough&#8230; but wait! Now if the user types in &#8220;Beauregard Charles Maurice&#8221; as a first name, if he inadvertently clicks on the text box again, his name will disappear. <em>He would need to type that all over again.</em> What can be done?</p>

<p>There may be multiple ways; but jQuery has a handy method called &#8220;one&#8221; which will execute an event <em>one time only</em>, which sounds like just what we want. So we&#8217;d change the body of that inner function to look like:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.clearme&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;focus&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">val</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<blockquote style="text-align:left">
***Notice of Account Closure***

Greetings,

This is a notification regarding your World of Warcraft account.  Access to this account has been permanently disabled for exploitation of the World of Warcraft economy or for being associated to accounts which have been closed for intended exploitation.  While we try to be as lenient as possible in our assessments of the results of exploitation investigations, reoccurring trends in exploitative endeavors on your account have ultimately resulted in account closure.

As a result, this account will no longer be able to access any aspect of World of Warcraft.  This action has been taken in accordance with the Terms of Use (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html) and our game policies (http://www.blizzard.com/support/wowgm/?id=agm01712p).  According to the World of Warcraft Terms of Use, to which all players agree when installing World of Warcraft, Section 3, Paragraph C [Rules Related to Game Play] states that you may not do anything that Blizzard Entertainment considers contrary to the &#8220;essence&#8221; of World of Warcraft.

Thank you for your time and understanding of our position in this matter.  Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have.

<p>Hmm. <em>Access to this account has been permanently disabled for exploitation of the World of Warcraft economy or for being associated to accounts which have been closed for intended exploitation.</em>  That&#8217;s interesting.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s especially interesting considering I cancelled my subscription over a month ago since I simply <em>did not have time to play World of Warcraft</em>. I&#8217;m fairly certain I have not logged on to any WoW server in well over two months, possibly longer.</p>

<p>I was considering re-activating the subscription at some point, if and/or when I have more free time to play MMORPG-type games (I just like typing MMORPG) &#8211; so this is a little annoying.</p>

<p>I replied to them; hopefully they can explain exactly what it is about <em>NOT PLAYING</em> that flags an account as &#8220;exploitative&#8221;.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Folks keep visiting this post, so I can only guess that this keeps happening to people, or that people are still trying to resolve it.</p>

<p>In my own case, my World of Warcraft account is <em>still closed</em>. The only means they will accept to re-open it, apparently, is for me to send them a fax (yes! a FAX) of my driver&#8217;s license. I don&#8217;t have a fax machine, nor a scanner most of the time, so I keep putting this off. I finally got around to doing it one day, and they replied that the incoming fax was too fuzzy and that I should scan my ID again and re-fax it.</p>

<p>That was about a year ago. I haven&#8217;t bothered to re-fax it yet.</p>
