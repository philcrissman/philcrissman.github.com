		<p><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/find_x.jpg" alt="" title="find_x" width="394" /><br /></p>

<p>The last couple posts have crossed over into a couple really big topics; one is web application usability, the other is the quality of results returned by an algorithm. They are not the same topic. Anything that can be made more usable should be. The quality of an algorithm&#8217;s results are not necessarily related to that. I started chatting with <a href="http://twitter.com/KuraFire">@Kurafire</a> about this, and he is making some great points&#8230; but I still don&#8217;t precisely agree.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/KuraFire/status/9266841104">The problem with Google&#8217;s algorithm is that a &#8220;mere&#8221; blog could outweigh the second-most visited website on the planet.</a></blockquote>




<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/KuraFire/status/9267865186">My point is that a site&#8217;s traffic rank should be weighed more heavily, certainly when the difference btwn the two is so huge.</a></blockquote>


<p>Let&#8217;s forget the &#8220;Facebook login&#8221; going to ReadWriteWeb rather than Facebook itself, for a moment. Let&#8217;s generalize.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size:1.5em;">Question: should an article <em>about</em> a company or entity <em>ever</em> get a higher search ranking than the website of the company or entity itself?</strong></p>

<p>When you phrase it that way, I think the answer is clearly <strong>YES</strong>, there are situations where that could and should happen.</p>

<p>In late 2001, it would make a lot of sense for a search for &#8220;ENRON quarterly earnings&#8221; to point to an article about the accounting scandal rather than simply going straight to an official PDF of their earnings.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s reasonable that a search for &#8220;Amway&#8221; could return an article skeptical of MLMs as high or sometimes higher than the company&#8217;s own site.</p>

<p>Not all the time, and not every time, but there are situations where an article about something could or should get a higher result than the thing itself.</p>

<p>A human being organizing the results might never do that; or they would only do it after it became obvious. Algorithms are dumb. They will just spit out a result based on some sort of process. Sometimes, that&#8217;s better, since it removes our innate bias to how we think things should be ordered. If we try to weight an algorithm too much for the things we innately think should be on top, we could actually be detracting from the value of the algorithm.</p>

<p>Just a thought. I&#8217;m by no means saying that the googorithm can do no wrong, or has no room for improvement. Just that it&#8217;s possible for dumb results to be better than &#8220;smart&#8221; results.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/2010/02/17/why-its-not-a-google-failure/">Why It&#8217;s Not a Google Failure</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>By far the most common and seemingly reasonable objections to my <a href="/2010/02/16/no-were-not-the-stupid-ones">recent post</a> about internet applications and users have been along these lines:</p>

<blockquote style="font-size: 1.5em;">Well, a ReadWriteWeb article about Facebook login is <em>certainly not the same</em> as Facebook&#8217;s actual login page. So if people are looking for Facebook&#8217;s login page, using Google, and are getting to a blog post instead, Google has indeed failed them.</blockquote>


<p>Guys, gals, listen. This sounds very reasonable. It sounds empathetic. It feels right.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 3em;">It&#8217;s wrong.</strong></p>

<p>Stop and think, for a second, what it means to hold the conclusion that Google has failed their users in this case. It would mean, first and foremost, that in an ideal world, <strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">Google should never have returned any other result than the Facebook login page as a response to the query &#8220;facebook login.&#8221;</strong> Okay; <em>if</em> that were true, what does that mean? Either:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Their algorithm is not good enough.</strong> It&#8217;s easy to say this, but let&#8217;s remember that this algorithm that is &#8220;not good enough&#8221; is the same algorithm that catapulted a startup out of nowhere to complete domination in a field (search) that was well saturated by large successful search engines, even in the late 90s; this algorithm that is &#8220;not good enough,&#8221; was nevertheless good enough to pull users away from every other established search engine.

In this case, for an algorithm to be &#8220;good enough&#8221; to anticipate this particular scenario, I think it would basically need to be fully fledged artificially intelligent. So great, good luck with that; have fun on the research staff at the major university of your choosing.

Also, I&#8217;d dare to suggest that if you can come up with a better algorithm, you have a corner office and a stack of VC money with your name on it waiting for you any time you want it, so get cracking.</li>
    <li><strong>Google should have anticipated this and manually set a top search result with the correct site for this query.</strong> It seems that people actually think this; it seems outrageous and unthinkable to me. There&#8217;s no way Google, or any other large service, could anticipate this. I mean, it would be insulting to even suggest it:

<strong>Engineer 1:</strong> Wait&#8230; wait&#8230; what if people are searching for a website login, and they query that? We should make sure that it is returned as the first result. Otherwise they might go to another page and think that they are on their website, and they will be confused that they can&#8217;t log in.
<strong>Engineers 2-999:</strong> Wait, now, the users may not be technical, but they aren&#8217;t <em>that</em> clueless. 
<strong>Engineer 1:</strong> But&#8230;
<strong>Engineers 2-999:</strong> Man, are you ever condescending.
<strong>Engineer 1:</strong> I just&#8230;
<strong>Engineers 2-999:</strong> Why do you hate users so much?
<strong>Engineer 1:</strong> But I&#8217;m just trying to help&#8230;
<strong>Engineers 2-999:</strong> Come on, users are going to <em>know</em> that they are not on the webpage they&#8217;re looking for. It won&#8217;t look the same. It&#8217;ll have a different name. Unless it&#8217;s a deliberate phishing scheme, and we are implementing this to detect and remove those&#8230; 
<em>(long technical discussion about programmatically detecting phishing sites begins)</em>

Seriously, stop and think about it. You would need to be <em>horribly and resolutely cynical</em> about the intelligence level of your users to even suggest, ahead of time, that they (for example) would mistake a blog post from a different website for a web application that they use regularly, possibly daily.

Besides that, there is an unwritten contract implied by Google&#8217;s search listings. The fact that sponsored listings occur (reasonably clearly marked) at the top of the list, implies that the rest of the search results are <em>untampered</em> with. They have been selected based on their relevance to the search query which you supplied. If Google can just select any old result at the top of the list, it completely destroys the credibility of the results.

<em>But wait,</em> you might say. <em>They could do something along the same lines as the &#8220;Did you mean: [this]? that they already attempt to do for common mispellings&#8230;&#8221;</em>. 

<img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/didyoumean.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2010-02-16 at 10.49.12 PM" width="248" height="140" />
<br />
<small>Oh, yeah, that *is* what I meant.</small><br />

Yep, they could. And it&#8217;s on this that I will concede, willingly, that perhaps they should try to do something like this in the future.

Where I disagree is the idea that they should have already been doing this; that they should have somehow (magically?) known that this would be necessary. 
</li>
</ol>


<p>So there&#8217;s that. I&#8217;m not saying <strong>&#8220;Screw the users, let them figure it out! Survival of the fittest FTW&#8221;</strong>. Really, I&#8217;m really not. Yes, absolutely, let&#8217;s make changes based on user behavior. Let&#8217;s make things easier to use when we find out they are not easy to use. Let&#8217;s do all those things.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s also say:</p>

<p>It is okay to expect your users to have a basic understanding of the core functionality of your application. In the case of Google, this is not asking very much of the user.</p>

<p><strong>Google:</strong> Okay, here&#8217;s how it works. You type something in the box.
<strong>User:</strong> Okay, I&#8217;m typing.
<strong>Google:</strong> &#8230; and I&#8217;ll try to find anything on the whole entire internet that seems to match what you&#8217;re searching for, and I&#8217;ll give you a list.
<strong>User:</strong> Great, so you&#8217;ll find exactly what I&#8217;m looking for.
<strong>Google:</strong> .Well, not exactly&#8230;. I&#8217;m going to find everything that <em>seems</em> to match, and I&#8217;m going to give you a list, and here&#8217;s the thing, it might be a humongous list&#8230;
<strong>User:</strong> Awesome, so you will find exactly what I&#8217;m looking for.
<strong>Google:</strong> &#8230; well, I&#8217;ll tell you what, I&#8217;m going to put what I <em>think</em> are the most relevant results near to the top of the list, okay, so chances are, hopefully&#8230;
<strong>User:</strong> Hey, that&#8217;s just what I was looking for. Thanks Google!
<strong>Google:</strong> Yes, well. That did work out pretty nicely. Actually, I hope it works that well every time, but you should understand that I&#8217;m just giving you a list of what I <em>think</em> will be the most relevant results, based on your query, and it might&#8230; hello? Hello?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.overcompensating.com/posts/20100216.html"><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/oc20100216.png" alt="" title="oc20100216" width="440"  /></a>
<small>I used to have to log on to the internet uphill, both ways.</small></p>

<p>Listen, I understand that it&#8217;s challenging. I don&#8217;t actually think &#8220;non-technical&#8221; people are &#8220;stupid,&#8221; any more than a tailor would think a programmer was &#8220;stupid&#8221; for being bewildered when sat down in front of a state of the art sewing machine. But if I&#8217;m going to insist on using the sewing machine, the tailor will try to tell me how to use it. If I continue to try to use it incorrectly, the tailor will eventually want to give up on me, unless I&#8217;m able to grasp <em>at least</em> the basic principles of how the thing works.</p>

<p><strong>The Tailor:</strong> <em>Look, it&#8217;s a sewing machine. See, here&#8217;s the bobbin&#8230;</em>
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>I don&#8217;t really want a bobbin, I want thread. Or the needle. I think.</em>
<strong>The Tailor:</strong> <em>The thread is on the bobbin&#8230; and it goes through the needle here&#8230;</em>
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>And I push this pedal now?</em>
<strong>The Tailor:</strong> <em>No, no, not now! Ok, so here is where you set the sort of stitch you want &mdash;</em>
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>I just want to sew these two pieces together. Won&#8217;t it just know what sort of stitch I want?</em>
<strong>The Tailor:</strong> <em>It&#8217;s just a machine, it doesn&#8217;t know anything. So we want this stitch here&#8230;</em>
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>How would I know that? That&#8217;s easy for <u>you</u> to do. Why does this have to be so hard?</em>
<strong>The Tailor:</strong> <em>If you&#8217;d just stop for a minute and learn to use it, it wouldn&#8217;t be that hard&#8230;</em>
<strong>Me:</strong> <em>This all strange and unknown and mysterious and frightening and frustrating. Sewing sucks! The designers of this machine are stupid!</em>
<em>(The Tailor gives up on me and goes to get a beer. I proceed to sew my index finger onto my jeans.)</em></p>

<p>Funkatron, <a href="http://funkatron.com/site/comments/were-the-stupid-ones-facebook-google-and-our-failure-as-developers/">whose post</a> on this contributed to inspiring the original rant, added some points to the end of his post in response; and since he&#8217;s a smart guy, he <em>completely understands</em> the point I was actually making (or attempting to make):</p>

<blockquote>I certainly don’t think that the computer can become (anytime soon) a magic box that determines our whims, nor do I think that people shouldn’t have to learn some things.</blockquote>


<p>This is the point exactly. If we really expect that Google should &#8220;just know&#8221; what we want, we are expecting it to be magical. We are asking for something that belongs to the realm of unicorns and rainbows with pots of gold at the end.</p>

<p><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/unicorn.jpg" alt="" title="unicorn" width="259" height="300" style="margin:0px auto" /><br />
<small>Magic Google Power!</small></p>

<p>At the risk of sounding like an asshole again, <span style="font-size:1.5em;">it&#8217;s called a <strong>search engine</strong>, not a <strong>finding engine</strong>. It cannot read your mind. If you expect it to be able to read your mind, you are stepping outside the bounds of what can reasonably be expected from a machine. The famous button is &#8220;I&#8217;m <strong>feeling lucky</strong>,&#8221; not &#8221;<strong>Take me to exactly the page I&#8217;m thinking about in my brain</strong>.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3>Neither You, Nor Me, Nor Google, Can Read Minds</h3>


<p>I&#8217;m married. Inevitably, my wife will say things or ask things, and lo and behold, <em>the thing that she really wants or means is not exactly the same thing as what she says</em>. Ideally, I would &#8220;just know&#8221; what she <strong>intends</strong> me to get from her comment or question. And while, over time (we&#8217;ve been married 8 1/2 great years), I can become a better guesser, <strong style="font-size:1.3em;">I will never be 100% able to do this because</strong> (surprise) <strong style="font-size:1.3em;">I cannot read minds.</strong></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the real point: <strong style="font-size:1.5em;">if I view myself as a failure because of my inability to read minds, I am setting myself up for misery. It is not reasonable to set <em>impossible tasks</em> as<em> criteria for success</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Really, if that one thing is not communicated in these most recent two posts, then I&#8217;m just not going to be able to communicate it. Expecting Google (or any software) to &#8220;know,&#8221; with certainty, my intentions, is completely absurd. And with that in mind, there is no way to call this a failure on the part of Google.</p>

<p>Ed goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>What I do think is that the current interface modern OSes on computers provide is simply overwhelming for most users, to the point that it’s very challenging to learn how to accomplish tasks without a very significant investment of time.</blockquote>


<p>Look, here I agree completely. I have agreed with this the whole time. I&#8217;m a huge supporter of user testing, of good UX design, and of changing things based on user feedback.</p>

<p>In fact, I&#8217;m probably just being a bit pedantic to be stuck on this one, single atom of disagreement, that is, the idea that Google or developers generally have &#8220;failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another example. When you go to a gas station to fill up your car (here in the US, at least), you can usually use a credit card at the pump to pay for your gas. A credit card has a magnetic stripe on one edge of one side of the card. So because I can flip a credit card upside down or front to back, there are four ways I can put the card into the slot, and only one way that the machine can read the magnetic stripe. Now, there is (almost) always a handy diagram showing you how you&#8217;re supposed to put the card into the machine. But people do it wrong all the time. Because the part of the card reader that reads the stripe is usually clear, there are normally only two obvious ways to insert the card: stripe up facing left, or stripe up facing right.</p>

<p>Now, at some point, some wonderful person who designs these machines said, <em>You know what? People are always putting their card in the wrong way. It would be really trivial to just put a magnetic stripe reader on both sides, and then as long as the stripe is at the top, it is impossible to insert the card incorrectly.</em> And they implemented it, and it seems to be standard on most new gas pumps.</p>

<p>Is the new design, where it is (almost) impossible to run your card incorrectly, better? Absolutely it is. It&#8217;s improved.</p>

<p><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/credit_card_swipe.jpg" alt="" title="credit_card_swipe" width="455" height="350" /><br />
<small>Hey, now that&#8217;s pretty handy.</small></p>

<p>Was the old design wrong? Was it a failure on the part of the gas pump card reader designers? I&#8217;m going to say <strong>no</strong>. It wasn&#8217;t wrong. It did what it was supposed to do, and asked only that the user glance at the diagram to know which way to put the stripe in to the card reader. There was room for improvement, and it was indeed improved, but it was not &#8220;wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve Krug&#8217;s disciples might now be saying, <em>The old design <strong>requires</strong> you to think, so it <strong>is</strong> failing! Don&#8217;t make people think!&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Steve Krug&#8217;s work is great, and I agree completely with the &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321344758?ie=UTF8&tag=idepermin-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321344758">Don&#8217;t Make Me Think</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=idepermin-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321344758" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />&#8221; mantra. But there comes a point, with anything, at which people must make a decision, and <strong>we have to assume that people will demonstrate some common sense</strong>.</p>

<div style="width: 435px;">

<p>So you can only take that so far.</p>

<p>If I want to sew, I can argue all day that sewing machines should be easier to use, and hey &mdash; maybe we can still come up with ways to improve their usability. But sooner or later, I need to accept that <strong>I must learn to use a sewing machine in order to get the results that I want</strong>. The responsibility is mine. It is not the sewing machine&#8217;s fault if I can&#8217;t stitch two things together.</p>

<p>And if I blame the sewing machine, <strong>I&#8217;m wrong</strong>.</p>

		<p>Update: follow up post on <a href="/2010/02/17/why-its-not-a-google-failure">why it&#8217;s not a Google failure</a>.</p>

<p>If you follow the same flow of information I do, you probably saw the article <a href="http://www.lastpodcast.net/2010/02/10/facebook-login-is-hard-welcome-to-idiocracy/">Facebook login is hard</a>, or are at least aware of the confusion it&#8217;s talking about. Just in case, for context: last week <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login.php">a ReadWriteWeb article</a> became the top-listed result on Google for &#8220;Facebook Login&#8221;, and several hundred (just going off the number of comments) Facebook users wound up at ReadWriteWeb trying unsuccessfully to log in to facebook, eventually leaving comments venting their frustration. <em>(Aside: my favorite was the one who found the &#8220;right&#8221; way to get to facebook, now: search for it on Bing instead&#8230;)</em></p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve started seeing comments and blog posts to the effect that <strong>this is actually a failure on the developers part</strong>; that bad UI or bad software/UX design is somehow <em>responsible</em> for this.</p>

<p>To which I say, <span style="font-size:3.5em;font-weight:bold;">bullshit.</span></p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of making things that have great user experience, intuitive UI, well developed information architecture, etc, etc. So I empathize with that line of thinking, to a point; yes, if there&#8217;s a city intersection that gets 500% more traffic accidents than every other intersection, maybe we should look at the urban planners and suggest they might have screwed it up and should now fix it. I don&#8217;t find this analogous to that, though.</p>

<p>Not (for example) with this:</p>

<blockquote>Isn&#8217;t this really a failure of Google? (From <a href="http://funkatron.com/site/comments/were-the-stupid-ones-facebook-google-and-our-failure-as-developers/">We&#8217;re the stupid ones</a>)</blockquote>


<p><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/bush_doing_it_wrong.jpg" alt="" title="bush_doing_it_wrong" width="150" height="150" align="right" style="margin-left: 5px;"  />No. <em><strong>It&#8217;s not a failure of Google</strong></em>. <strong>RWW wrote an article about Facebook Connect &mdash; about logging in with Facebook &mdash; and said article became a top result for the phrase &#8220;Facebook login&#8221; on Google.</strong> That is an example of Google <em>working as it is intended to work</em>.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s fine if people use a search engine field as a sort of web-based CLI; heck I use it for that, if I&#8217;m looking for a site and don&#8217;t remember if it&#8217;s <em>.com</em> or <em>.net</em> or <em>.info</em>, or if it&#8217;s <em>somethingapp.com</em> or <em>somethinghq.com</em> or <em>getsomething.com</em>, and hey, if I <strong>know</strong> that it&#8217;ll come up if I simply search for it, then yes: why not. Search is quicker than having to try even one extra URL because the first one you used the wrong TLD. So using a search engine to find your website: fine, go for it. I&#8217;m not arguing that this should be discouraged. <em>(That said, I believe there have been studies showing that people actually also search for fully qualified URLs, like &#8220;myspace.com,&#8221; and really, it does seem like someone should tell those folks about the address bar&#8230; but I digress.)</em></p>

<p>Facebook evidently has somewhere in the neighborhood of a bazillion users, now. I don&#8217;t want to stop and look it up, so lets just say it&#8217;s one bazillion, where <code>100 million &lt; 1 bazillion &lt; infinity</code>; in that neighborhood somewhere. So the several hundred confused and frustrated users were something along the lines of a fraction of a rounding error on a percentage point of Facebook&#8217;s entire user base. Not what I would call a UI catastrophe.</p>

<p>This is not to say that these people are not important, only that it is okay to expect them to learn how to use the internet. <span style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold;">It is okay to expect people to invest a little time to learn how stuff works and to retain an adequate portion of that education.</span></p>

<p><small>Just because it&#8217;s photoshopped doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not funny.</small><img src="http://philcrissman.com/images/posts/elephants-larger-than-the-moon.jpg" alt="" title="elephants-larger-than-the-moon" width="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2101" /></p>

<p>Take ReadWriteWeb. I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;d win an <em>award</em> for UI or UX, but they don&#8217;t suck. I think that it&#8217;s fairly clear that ReadWriteWeb is a distinct website named <em>ReadWriteWeb</em>. I don&#8217;t think we should have expected them to introduce a flashing banner warning visitors: ATTENTION &#8211; THIS SITE IS NOT ACTUALLY FACEBOOK. They wrote an article, that article got some google juice. All in all, they&#8217;re doing what they set out to do, writing stuff that is findable to the people who are looking for it.</p>

<p>Taking an event like this one and suggesting that it is somehow the fault of the designers of Google and/or developers generally, is absurd. It just <em>isn&#8217;t</em>. I empathize with some of what folks are saying (Funkatron, linked above, for example). If they just want to say <em>maybe we&#8217;re being too hard on people</em>, I could grant a <em>well maybe</em>, but overall, look:</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;font-weight:bold;">If I search for &#8220;basecamp&#8221; in Google and wind up at a mountain climbing equipment supply store instead of the 37signals product I wanted, <u>it is not <em>Google</em>&#8217;s fault</u> (or 37signals&#8217;, or the camping store&#8217;s) if I start banging my head against the screen and asking &#8220;Wheerre are my prooooojectsssss?????&#8221;</span></p>

<p>It just isn&#8217;t.</p>

No, let&#8217;s not have rules. I don&#8217;t feel comfortable with having coding standards or any protocol on Camping. The point of Camping is to have very ugly, tricky code that goes against all the rules that people make for &#8220;beautiful&#8221; code these days. To show that ugly code can do beautiful things, maybe.

I don&#8217;t want to demonize anyone here, I just want to express the ideas that make Camping different. Camping&#8217;s personality is 80x50. It is like the little gears of a watch that are all meshed together into a tight little mind-bending machine. The challenge of Camping isn&#8217;t to figure out how to automate obfuscation. The challenge is to bring new tricks into the code that push Ruby&#8217;s parser and make everyone look twice. Not all code needs to be a factory, some of it can just be origami.

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/2009/07/24/scriptconsole-under-the-hood/">Script/console, Under the Hood</a></h1>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently started digging into script/console a little deeper. As a tool for Rails development, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that words like &#8220;indispensable&#8221; come to mind when the topic of the console arises. That said, I&#8217;ve yet to see a really complete guide to using script/console &#8211; lots and lots of collections of tips and tricks, but never a good solid guide to what&#8217;s going on with script/console.</p>

<p>This is the first of what will hopefully be several posts about what&#8217;s really going on when you open the rails console.</p>

<p>If we look at just the console script, we&#8217;ll find just these three lines:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>script/console  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dirname</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">__FILE__</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/../config/boot&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;commands/plugin&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first line is simply the shebang line that lets the file be an executable ruby script. The second line requires the file config/boot. This file is a little over a hundred lines by default, so we won&#8217;t reproduce it here; you can read it quickly (if you want to) in one of your own rails projects. It basically sets some load paths and some constants, and ends by booting rails with <code>Rails.boot!</code>.</p>

<p>The third line requires <code>commands/console</code>&#8230; and that&#8217;s it. So to see what&#8217;s actually happening, we&#8217;ll have to look there.</p>

<p>You can find <code>commands/console.rb</code> in <code>railties/lib</code> in your rails directory, in <code>vendor</code> if you have frozen rails to a specific version, or otherwise under your rails gem in the lib directory.</p>

<p>(e.g., on this machine it&#8217;s in
 /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rails/lib/commands/console.rb).</p>

<p><code>console.rb</code> looks like this:</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a fair bit in there, so let&#8217;s look at what it&#8217;s doing in detail.</p>

<p>Line 1 is setting a local variable named <code>irb</code>. It checks to see if the constant <code>RAILS_PLATFORM</code> matches a value that would indicate we&#8217;re using some flavor of Microsoft Windows; if we are, it sets <code>irb</code> to <code>irb.bat</code>, which is what irb will be named for a Windows build of ruby; otherwise it&#8217;s set to simply <code>irb</code>, which is the commands name on *nix systems, including Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Next it requires &#8216;optparse&#8217;. <code>optparse</code> is a Ruby library for parsing options (I imagine you guessed that).</p>

<p>Then a local variable named <code>options</code> is created, and is given a few default parameters: <code>:sandbox</code> is set to false (more on this in a moment), and <code>:irb</code> is set to the local variable irb (in other words, to either &#8216;irb.bat&#8217; or &#8216;irb&#8217;, depending on the result of the expression on line 1).</p>

<p>An <code>OptionsParser</code> object is created next. We won&#8217;t dive into the details of this, but you&#8217;ll note a striking similarity to what you see in this block and what you&#8217;ll see if you type <code>script/console -h</code> in your rails root.</p>

<p>So if we follow along, we&#8217;ll read about the three standard command line arguments we can use when firing up the console:</p>

<p><code>--sandbox</code>, which just adds the feature that any changes you make to the database will be undone at the end of your console session
<code>--irb</code>, which allows you to choose a different version of irb if applicable; so, if you have Ruby 1.9 installed, but not set as your default ruby version, you could start up the console with <code>script/console --irb=irb1.9</code>, and see how your console experiments work with Ruby 1.9.
<code>--debugger</code>, which enables ruby debugging.</p>

<p>Next a local variable named <code>libs</code> is created; it&#8217;s a string, and a number of lines are concatenated to it, each in the form &#8221; -r [some library or module]&#8221;. The libs variable is eventually going to be passed to irb when the console starts it; the -r switch to irb simple requires whatever the next argument is. So this is simply building a list of the modules and libraries which are going to be present when the console is fired up.</p>

<p>The next section handles the case where you have actually typed <code>script/console --debugger</code>; it tries to require ruby-debug, and if an exception is raised, it will helpfully suggest that you run <code>gem install ruby-debug</code>.</p>

<p>On line 31, console sets the environment; it looks at your first argument to see if you tried to specify an environment, and if not, sets it to either <code>ARGV.first</code> (the first argument, if applicable), <code>ENV['RAILS_ENV']</code> (whatever the environment is already set to), or as a last resort to &#8217;<code>development</code>&#8217; (which is probably what you want, most of the time, hence why you may only rarely use this feature).</p>

<p>If you try this by typing <code>script/console foo</code>, you&#8217;ll see that console will try (and fail, unless you&#8217;ve created a foo environment) to find the file <code>/config/environments/foo.rb</code>. So as long as the environment you specify exists, the console will use it.</p>

<p>Now, since it&#8217;s using <code>ARGV.first</code>, you might ask yourself why, if you type <code>script/console --sandbox</code>, the console does not try to load the &#8221;<code>--sandbox</code>&#8221; environment. Good question! The answer can be found up in line 11: <code>opt.parse!(ARGV)</code>. The <code>parse!</code> method parses destructively; it pulls any valid options out of <code>ARGV</code>, and then returns whatever&#8217;s left over. So if <code>ARGV</code> started out as <code>"test --sandbox --irb=irb1.9"</code>, after <code>opts.parse!(ARGV)</code> it will just equal <code>"test"</code>. If nothing but valid options were supplied (i.e., no attempt to specify an environment), ARGV would be an empty string, and the environment will be set to either <code>ENV['RAILS_ENV'</code>], if it exists, or to &#8216;development&#8217; if it doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>So now console&#8217;s figured out which environment to use, it checks to see if you&#8217;ve specified the sandbox option, and if you have, it prints a friendly message to remind you that anything you do to the database will be undone when you exit the console.</p>

<p>But wait, you might say. Other than print a message, it doesn&#8217;t do anything; what actually makes the sandbox/database rollback work? Good question. If you look back up at lines 14-18, where the libs variable is set, you&#8217;ll note that <code>console_sandbox</code> is required, but <em>only if</em> <code>options[:sandbox]</code> returns true. <code>console_sandbox</code> will take care of all that database rollback headache for us; so that&#8217;s where it will come from.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s only one line left: an <code>exec</code> expression. exec is going to execute the string you pass to it on the command line. So a plain vanilla run of script/console is actually running:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>irb -r irb/completion -r ~/your_rails_project_path/config/environment -r console_app -r console_with_helpers --simple_prompt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you really want to, you could just type all that every time you want to use the console, but I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;ll stick with script/console.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking there must be a little more to it than this, you&#8217;re right; you&#8217;ll remember that when <code>libs</code> was created, the modules <code>console_app</code> and <code>console_with_helpers</code> were required. That may be what I write about next, but in the meantime, if you have Rails installed you can always just open those files up and see what&#8217;s in them.</p>
