	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xiaming/99206245/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/30/99206245_862bc5c93d.jpg?v=0" /></a>
<small>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xiaming/99206245/">xiaming</a></small></p>

<p>One of the hallmarks of object oriented programming in most every implementation of it that I know of is the ability to designate certain methods as &#8220;private&#8221; or &#8220;protected&#8221;, thus keeping them from being called willy-nilly by any old script that wants to call them. Ruby also has this, of course, but interestingly enough it can be easily circumvented.</p>

<p>I guess there are a few posts floating around about it, but I discovered it by accident playing around in irb this evening. I was reading David A. Black&#8217;s The Well Grounded Rubyist, where he mentions that you could send a message to a class either within the class definition itself, or by simply sending it to the class object like you&#8217;d send any other message:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># The normal way to do it</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Thing</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">message</span> <span class="ss">:whatever</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># you could also do this</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">Thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:whatever</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>David mention&#8217;s attr_accessor in this context, so I thought I&#8217;d try that. Open <code>irb</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Thing</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sc">?&gt;</span> <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="no">Thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">attr_accessor</span> <span class="ss">:name</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="no">NoMethodError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">private</span> <span class="nb">method</span> <span class="s1">&#39;attr_accessor&#39;</span> <span class="n">called</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="no">Thing</span><span class="ss">:Class</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Oh. So much for that, then. But, knowing of the existence of the send method, I thought I&#8217;d try that.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:attr_accessor</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For the non-<code>irb</code> user, that <code>nil</code> that was returned, and the fact that no error message was returned, indicated that our experiment worked. Now <code>Thing</code>&#8217;s have a name attribute.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Larry&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Larry&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Larry&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What&#8217;s interesting about all this is that <code>attr_accessor</code> is a private method on <code>Class</code>. Yet we just called it.</p>

<p><code>send</code> is often introduced as a way to show how everything is an object and that you can do exciting things like <code>1.send(:+, 1)</code> and get <code>2</code> as the result. No one usually mentions that it can be used to call private or protected methods from outside a given class.</p>

<p>To make it clear what you could do here:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Thing</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, yes. You can do this, if you so choose. Please use your powers for good, and not for evil.</p>

<p>Now <em>why</em> this works, I can&#8217;t yet say, though I&#8217;m interested in learning, if there is a reason. Evidently there <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/7404">may have been some debate</a> as to whether ruby 1.9 would still have this behavior, but as of this writing it does.</p>

<p>Note: I did only a brief search, and it seems <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=ruby+send+method&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">this functionality is not unknown</a>, though it still seems somewhat odd to me that such an easy way to sidestep the private/protected designation of methods exists.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You&#8217;re being a Good Software developer and diligently testing all your code, and lo and behold, you get this result to one of your tests:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="no">Failure</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">gt</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">expected</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">was</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">gt</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>An annoying problem with floats that might look and for all practical purposes be equal, but internally as stored by the computer are not <em>precisely</em> equal.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re probably using:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">assert_equal</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a_value_expected_to_be_1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Instead, use:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">assert_in_delta</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a_value_expected_to_be_1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mo">000001</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Though, you may also want to ask yourself if you really need to be using floating point numbers; but assuming that you <em>do</em> need them, <code>assert_in_delta</code> will compensate for the annoying fact that floating point numbers might not actually be precisely what you expect them to be.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/2009/01/18/testing-ajax-requests-in-rails/">Testing Ajax Requests in Rails</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Just figured out a test on which I spent far too long wondering why it wasn&#8217;t working. I kept coming back to it and trying something else, and it kept not working.</p>

<p>We have a form which submits to a create action by a remote_form_for; so, an Ajax request, in other words. The controller action just uses <code>render :update</code> and replaces some HTML instead of redirecting. But in every other respect, it&#8217;s a POST to the controller, and is going to call :create. Easy, right?</p>

<p>We&#8217;re using shoulda, and despite having a perfectly reasonable <code>post :create, :whatever_id => @thing.id, :our_model => { :stuff => "stuff" }</code> in the setup, it wasn&#8217;t actually creating the item; shoulda&#8217;s handy <code>should_change "Thing.count", :by => 1</code> kept failing.</p>

<p>I finally just started flipping through The Literature (in this case, the Rails Way&#8217;s chapter on testing), and happened to notice an off-hand remark that, in addition to methods for POST, PUT, GET, etc, there was an <code>xhr</code> method, to simulate an XMHHttpRequest.</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>What I should have been writing, all along, was:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">:whatever_id</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="vi">@thing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="ss">:our_model</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:stuff</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;stuff&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&#8217;s always the little things.</p>

<p>Remember to read the literature.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My wife has gone to Thailand for two weeks. So I&#8217;m on my own.</p>

<p>I am, as they say, &#8220;batching it&#8221; for a couple weeks. This is usually understood to mean that I will wear the same underwear for two weeks, eat nothing but junk food, abandon cleaning the house, and play video games all night.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t working out so well.</p>

<p>The video game thing isn&#8217;t happening. I look at my X-box (old one, not a 360) and think, <em>I could sit and play something for&#8230; for, well for hours.</em> But then I think, <em>But I&#8217;ve finished all the games I own. And I don&#8217;t really feel like replaying them yet, and I could go get a new used game, but I can&#8217;t think of anything I&#8217;d want to own, and really, is that responsible?</em></p>

<p>I tried to leave the dishes in the sink. Normally this is no problem. This week I keep looking at them and thinking, <em>Sheesh, it&#8217;s only going to take five more seconds to put it in the dishwasher.</em> And the next thing I know, it&#8217;s in the dishwasher.</p>

<p>I bought a huge bag of potato chips when I went grocery shopping. They are still sitting unopened on the kitchen table. Every time I look at them, I think, <em>Those sound good, but I should really eat some real food. Those aren&#8217;t very good for me.</em></p>

<p>I have a strange compulsion to vacuum the rug. I can&#8217;t explain it, it&#8217;s just there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried leaving my clothes on the floor when I change, but it just throws the whole room off. I have to put them in the hamper.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m beginning to think that I am no longer a very good bachelor.</p>

<p>Oh, I can talk the talk. I can say I&#8217;ll eat cereal two meals a day, shower &#8220;later,&#8221; and stay up till 3am. Except that there are some leftovers to eat, and that sounds a little better. Or maybe pasta. Or a roast. With some potatoes and broccoli. And I will feel a lot better if I have a shower, and 3am&#8230; man, I need to get up early, I can&#8217;t do that.</p>

<p>So far, I have not shaved my face. I am counting that as a point for the &#8220;batching it&#8221; score.</p>

<p>But for now, I should get back to work. And if I&#8217;m not going to open those potato chips, I think I should really take them off the kitchen table and put them in the pantry.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hold strong opinions about the placement of curly braces.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t care where K &amp; R put them, I&#8217;ll put them wherever I want to put them. And don&#8217;t even start with the CSS files with the closing curly brace indented inline with the rules. Where did that come from?</p>

<p>It appears that I also hold strong opinions about indentation. Also, on whether or not a space should be left on the inside of opening and closing delimiters before the argument(s) they contain, where such delimiters are optional, whether or not they should be used, and whether or not text should wrap in the source listing, .</p>

<p>I have strong opinions about choices of languages to use for programming. Although I will concede, probably grudgingly, that there are other languages which may be faster, more elegant, more efficient, or more popular than my favorite language(s), this will not alter my preference, and if pressed I will defend my language regardless of its perceived shortcomings. If nothing else, I will claim that my language is more fun, or some other reason for its superiority which has nothing to do with programming languages <em>per se</em>. Furthermore, I will not accept the use of these same arguments if used to show that a different language is somehow superior to my favorite language or languages.</p>

<p>I have a great respect for people who understand topics or concepts which I do not understand yet, but which I nevertheless place on a pedestal as pinnacles of programming wisdom.</p>

<p>I have deeply held convictions about text editors. Really, it&#8217;s better not to talk about it. Just walk away.</p>

<p>I am strongly attached to the frameworks and libraries which I approve of, and repulsed by the ones of which I do not approve. Large libraries which I like are <em>multifaceted</em>, while the ones which I do not like are <em>bloated</em>. Small libraries which I like are <em>elegant and efficient</em>, while those which I do not like are <em>incomplete or trivial</em>.</p>

<p>I have strong opinions about Operating Systems. People who are not using my favorite Operating System would be far more productive if they would simply &#8220;wake up&#8221; and get &#8220;real computers&#8221;. Brilliant people whom I respect but who nevertheless use other Operating Systems are exempt.</p>

<p>We should talk about indentation some more. I hold opinions on whether said indentations should use spaces or tabs, and how many spaces they should use. They are only opinions. However, if you do not share them, you are probably wrong.</p>

<p>When there is more than one way to do something, I will have an opinion on which is the best way to do it. This opinion is correct, although I may tell you that your way of doing it is fine also. <em>I am just being nice. Your way is retarded, slow, inefficient, insufficiently clever, unmaintainable, obfuscated or deprecated, pick two.</em></p>

<p>I have opinions about software development methodologies. These opinions cover project management styles, agile methodologies, artifacts, modeling languages, and best practices. Projects which fail to do well invariably failed because they neglected an area which I feel very strongly about, and will describe to you in great detail if you show a sign you are interested.</p>

<p>I am deeply attached to my preferred tool for source control management, which is better than your preferred tool for source control management, unless you happen to prefer the same one, in which case you are correct.</p>

<p>I have a favorite computer acronym, a favorite obsolete piece of hardware, a favorite programming anecdote, joke, historical event, and aphorism. I have a favorite algorithm, meme, binary operator, ascii character and UTF entity. I have a favorite NP Complete problem, which is more interesting than your favorite NP Complete problem, even though they can both be shown to be reducible to a common problem, or even to each other.</p>

<p>Despite my not yet having designed or created a killer app, I am convinced that I know why other apps have failed, and will not hesitate to share this knowledge if prompted. Despite having not run a multi-million dollar technology company, I know exactly what is wrong with the companies which are out there, and how they could be fixed.</p>

<p>Just don&#8217;t ask me about politics or religion, now; I prefer not to be argumentative on the internet.</p>
