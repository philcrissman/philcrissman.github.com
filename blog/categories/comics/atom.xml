<p>I think I mentioned already that I've been rereading Cerebus comics. The first time I read them, I never did get my hands on "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0919359078/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=idepermin-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0919359078&amp;adid=01FA6RVVXWRQRRTR8DQV&amp;">High Society</a>" or "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0919359094/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=idepermin-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0919359094&amp;adid=1NEE9ZRHV08T9JNTKZXE&amp;">Church and State</a>"; I had read the first volume out of a library, and then started with "Jaka's Story" through "Melmoth" and most of the "Mothers &amp; Daughters" story line. Then I fell off the bus for a bit. I've now caught up to about issue 226 (part way through "Rick's Story"). So, I'm well past "re-reading" and have moved on to just "reading". Looking forward to the conclusion (the entire run of Cerebus is 300 issues, an amazing accomplishment by a single creative team).</p>

<p>Sim's a fantastic artist, as is his co-conspirator Gerhard, and a great story-teller, both visually and simply in prose (there's a lot of straight prose in certain parts of Cerebus). Well worth a read.</p>
