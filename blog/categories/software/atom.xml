    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>... even the best of these APIs are hard to use because the documentation, supposedly written in English, is terrible. Most engineers can't write a single coherent sentence, never mind string together a paragraph.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think I'd agree with this, but with reservations. For starters, I think many of the developers I know are better than average writers. Maybe I'm in an anomolous community, but that's my impression. Second, just because someone <em>can</em> write well, doesn't mean they will write any documentation, let alone <em>good</em> documentation. It's food for thought, though.</p>
