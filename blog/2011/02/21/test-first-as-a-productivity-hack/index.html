<p>If you&#8217;re like me, and live primarily online, you have countless distractions in the form of blogs, news sites, photo sites, chat applications, twitter/facebook, web comics, etc. It&#8217;s really easy to sit down at your computer, and if you&#8217;re not focused, simply call up <a href="http://thisisnthappiness.com">TIH</a> or <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">HN</a> or <a href="http://bestofwikipedia.tumblr.com">bestofwikipedia</a> and soon find the first hour of your day has been completely sucked up just <em>looking at stuff</em>.</p>

<p>Well, if you&#8217;re a contractor or freelancer, that may not be how you wanted to spend the first hour of your day. You just lost an hour of billable time; do that every day and you&#8217;re cheating yourself out of a lot of hours, especially if (guilty look) you&#8217;re prone to a similar web-surfing session after returning from lunch.</p>

<p>Something I&#8217;ve started doing, that I&#8217;ve found to be a great help in avoiding losing focus like this, is to sit down and make the <em>my very first task</em> to be writing a test for the app that I&#8217;m currently working on.</p>

<p>So, in this context, I&#8217;m not talking about &#8220;test first&#8221; in the TDD (Test Driven Development) sense, although I do practice that. I mean &#8220;test first&#8221; literally, as, <em>when my seat hits the chair, and my fingers touch the keyboard, write a test</em>.</p>

<p>This accomplishes a few different things.</p>

<ol>
<li>An immediate thing to focus on. Part of the reason I get distracted by the web is that I may not have an <em>immediate</em> action to start on. Having an immediate, easy to start, first action makes a world of difference.</li>
<li>It gets me in the &#8220;work&#8221; mindset and flow. It doesn&#8217;t matter what the test is. It might be as simple as a throw-away &#8220;when I go to this page, I should see the correct page title&#8221; test &#8211; the point isn&#8217;t that this test <em>needs</em> to be written for the health of the application&#8217;s test suite; it&#8217;s simply a hack to get you into work-mode. Once I look at the code, add a test, make sure it runs, by then I&#8217;ve only spent about 2-4 minutes, but I&#8217;ve avoided getting side-tracked, and I&#8217;m already into the codebase, so it&#8217;s very natural to look at what needs to be done next, and start doing it.</li>
<li>Hey, if I choose wisely, some of this uber-simple tests I&#8217;m adding as a first action may actually be useful. If a test is <em>truly</em> trivial, you probably just want to delete it; but chances are you can find <em>something</em> simple to test that actually does need to be true in the finished app; all the better. You <em>have</em> actually improved your test suite, while simultaneously avoiding that &#8220;morning distraction&#8221; time, and getting yourself into the flow of <em>getting things done</em>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Your mileage may vary. But it&#8217;s been working for me. Adding something like the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro technique</a> to this means that I&#8217;ll still get a chance to catch up on my blogs/etc during the day, but without the trap of spending my first hour surfing mindlessly.</p>

<p>What are your &#8220;get back to work&#8221; hacks?</p>
