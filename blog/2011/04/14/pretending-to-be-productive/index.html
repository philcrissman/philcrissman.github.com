<p>title: Pretending to be Productive
date: 14/04/2011</p>

<p>I&#8217;m noticing recently that I use a few of things that make me feel more productive, when I&#8217;m not <em>necessarily</em> any more productive by using them. Maybe.</p>

<h1>Focusbooster</h1>

<p>I really like <a href="http://www.focusboosterapp.com/">focusbooster</a>. It&#8217;s a cool little app. It&#8217;s a basic <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro</a> timer made in Adobe Air, so it&#8217;s shiny and easy to install. You start it, and it times you for 25 minutes (during which time you are to be <em>hard at work</em>), and then starts counting down a 5 minute break (during which I guess you&#8217;re supposed to look at twitter or hacker news or pictures of Bettie Page (hi, <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/">Merlin</a>)).</p>

<p>Maybe focusbooster works for some people, but I find it doesn&#8217;t really work <em>that</em> much for me. I qualify it only because, sure, it serves as a subtle reminder: while the 25-minute timer is running, I&#8217;m working. I&#8217;m not doing <em>whatever</em>. That said, it&#8217;s easy to ignore. Especially if you&#8217;re like me and habitually ignore the break. I guess the 5 minute break is supposed to be the carrot on the stick that keeps you hard at work for the prior 25 minutes, but for me, I usually am halfway through writing or testing some method or class for an application, and I&#8217;m not going to stop and take a break, I keep working right through my &#8220;break&#8221;. Which leads to basically running focusbooster all day and generally ignoring it.</p>

<p>Which is fine, I guess, if only for those handful of times where the fact that there&#8217;s a little timer running on your desktop reminds you that you&#8217;re working. So I do like it, even though I feel like a lot of the imagined productivity I feel from a day of using it might be illusory.</p>

<p>Maybe if it was going to cut one of my kid&#8217;s fingers off whenever I visited Facebook it would be more effective, but I think that sort of thing is frowned on.</p>

<h1>RescueTime</h1>

<p>So, <a href="http://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> is neat. It&#8217;s an app that lives on your desktop and records what you&#8217;re doing and then sort of tells you what you&#8217;ve been up to, and how productive or distracted you&#8217;ve been. You can teach it which of your activities you consider &#8220;productive&#8221; or &#8220;distracting&#8221;. You can delete some of your activities, if desired.</p>

<p>So, again, I sort of like it. But at the same time, I&#8217;m a little obsessive when I see a chart like the one on the RescueTime dashboard. I want to be at the far right end, in the &#8220;productive&#8221; zone. Trouble is, it&#8217;s very very easy to start &#8220;tweaking&#8221; your activities to make your overall day look more productive. &#8220;That 12 minutes on twitter? No, no, that was when I just left my browser open to that page and walked away for a bit. I can delete that. Hm, 5 minutes visiting <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/">leancrew.com</a>? That&#8217;s not -2 Distracting, we&#8217;ll call that +1 Productive.&#8221; You can also game it in other ways. Leave your computer open to your text editor or the terminal when you walk away, and it&#8217;s recording all that idle time as &#8220;Productive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re cheating,&#8221; you may say. &#8220;You&#8217;re like, you&#8217;re like the guy who reshuffles the cards while playing solitaire. Bad developer. Bad.&#8221; Mmm. Maybe. I don&#8217;t know. Regardless, even though I feel like some of the &#8220;productivity&#8221; it&#8217;s showing me is <em>not necessarily real</em>, it still helps just to know that it&#8217;s on. It&#8217;s one of those reminders, &#8220;Hm, this is going to show up as &#8216;distracting&#8217; on RescueTime; I should bookmark it and look at it later.&#8221; And that&#8217;s basically good.</p>

<h1>And all that means is</h1>

<p>I don&#8217;t know. I started out talking about &#8220;pretend productivity&#8221; and in each case I essentially just argued that I am actually still being helped, at least a little, to be more productive by running apps like these. Maybe. I&#8217;m not actually sure.</p>

<p>So, what gives you the false sense of security that you&#8217;ve been productive today?</p>
