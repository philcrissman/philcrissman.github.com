<p>title: How To Read Web Analytics
date: 10/10/2011</p>

<p>The CEO of BigCorp just got the company&#8217;s web analytics report and is
trying to make sense of it. He calls in his lead developer and asks him
what the analytics report says.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing great,&#8221; says the developer. &#8220;Look at all these hits and
page views. We&#8217;re having no scaling issues. The report says everything
is going well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Happy but not satisfied, the CEO calls in his head of marketing and asks
her what the analytics report says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so good,&#8221; says the head of marketing. &#8220;We have a lot of page views,
but no one is sticking around very long or drilling deeper into the
site. We need to generate more content and revamp our web design.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little nervous now, the CEO also calls in the SEO consultant who&#8217;s
been working with the company, and asks the consultant what the
analytics report says.</p>

<p>The SEO consultant spends a few minutes reading the report. After
looking around to make sure the door is closed and no one is listening,
the SEO consultant leans forward and asks, &#8220;What would you like it to
say?&#8221;</p>
