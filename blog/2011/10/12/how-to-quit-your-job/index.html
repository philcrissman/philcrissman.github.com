<p>title: How to quit your job
date: 12/10/2011</p>

<p>So you want to quit your job. Welcome to the club. Membership is free,
we don&#8217;t have meetings or rules, but we also don&#8217;t give you a t-shirt or
a name-tag on a colorful lanyard. So, yeah. Pros and cons.</p>

<p>You may or may not have, or have had, a job you dislike. That&#8217;s not
really the issue. Maybe your job is great. That can sometimes make it
harder. Regardless, you want to quit; not to go get another job, but to
go off on your own and do&#8230; well, whatever it is you do.</p>

<p>So, now what? Well, the title of this post oversells a bit. I don&#8217;t have
a clue how, or even <em>if</em>, you should quit your job. I can tell you what
I did. Twice.</p>

<p>Roll back to 2008. I worked for Oracle Corporation in a support role.
The people I worked with were top notch, but I had been in tech support
for about 5 years at that point, and I was completely burnt out on
counseling people with what to do about exceeding their inbox quota. I
wanted to move into development, something I was going to school for and
would play around with in my spare time. I had developed small
Coldfusion and PHP apps, and some academic apps with Java, and wayyyyy
back in high school (that would be, in the late 80s) some BASIC and
Pascal. I was just starting to learn Ruby on Rails, but at that point
&#8220;learning&#8221; meant only, scaffolding and mucking about with a very basic
app. I was toying with the idea of quitting and going into freelance
web-development. With a little bit of networking, I had wound up with 2
possible full-time contracts right at the same time. Both would require
me to quit my job to go full-time on the contract. One was a PHP
application. The other was a Ruby on Rails job. After not very much
deliberation, I chose to go with the Ruby contract.</p>

<p>The Ruby contract was in essence an internship. My rate was very low,
but I was just learning. It wound up being a fantastic opportunity for a
new-to-rails developer; I was able to work with Jon Dahl and Luke Francl
(both of <a href="http://railspikes.com">RailSpikes</a>, among other things) on a startup called
<a href="http://tumblon.com">tumblon</a>.
I&#8217;m going to be honest; some of the code I wrote was probably awful. But
it mostly worked, and when it didn&#8217;t, I figured out why and changed it
so it did work. I also had the benefit of working on a codebase which
had already been around for 8-10 months, so when there were things that
I didn&#8217;t know how to do, I could look to see what Jon and Luke had
already done in other parts of the app. I&#8217;m pretty sure I learned better
habits by doing that than I would if I had been forced to teach myself
Rails all on my own.</p>

<h2>If at all possible, work with people who are smarter/more experienced</h2>

<p>than you, and read all their code.</p>

<p>So, that was helpful. Tumblon eventually ran low on funding, so I moved
on to work with some other local folks, like Matt Bauer (currently
founder of <a href="http://pedalbrain.com">Pedalbrain</a>) and Todd Emmel
(<a href="http://slantwiselabs.com">Slantwise Labs</a>) for the next
couple years.</p>

<p>During this time, I continued to learn a lot, frequently by doing things
wrong and needing to figure out how to do them right. I continued to
raise my rates as I learned more about what I was doing.</p>

<p>Early this year, 2011, the work at Slantwise Labs ran dry. A couple
contracts finished up, and I was left without any work for a few weeks.
At first I wasn&#8217;t concerned, but when there continued to be no new work
for a couple more weeks, I started to look a little harder. Also, we had
a newborn by this time, so the pressure was a little higher than in
times past. So, I took a full-time job.</p>

<p>The job I took was doing Ruby on Rails for a local <a href="http://ackmanndickenson.com">web development
shop</a>
&#8211; a great company with a great team, by the way. I was hoping that it
would work out; I planned to stay there for at least a year, if not two.
I figured the stability of a full-time gig, the benefits, the vacation
days, would balance out and compensate for the things I missed from
contracting.</p>

<p>It turns out I was not correct in that assumption. I really started to
miss the freedom, and marginally higher income, of contracting. After
debating internally for weeks, I finally decided I had to go back to
freelance work. I decided ahead of time to finish the project I was
working on, gave them plenty of notice, and made sure I had something
lined up for the following month.</p>

<h2>Always make sure you have something else lined up.</h2>

<p>This is the problem I made earlier this year. I had grown a little
complacent that I could always find a new project without really trying
all that hard. Actually, I was probably just lucky. In any case, going
forward, I knew I would need (and will need) to keep my eyes on when a
project or contract is going to end, and make sure that there is another
project or contract lined up soon after the current one finishes.</p>

<h2>Do the best work you can possibly do. Totally own it. If you write</h2>

<p>something that sucks, own that too. If possible, of course, fix it
yourself.</p>

<p>A huge benefit I&#8217;ve had is that I&#8217;m pretty sure anyone I&#8217;ve worked for
in the past three years, I could work for again. I&#8217;ve learned a ton, and
I continue to push myself to learn more. Realize that you don&#8217;t
necessarily need to find clients directly &#8211; I&#8217;ve done almost 100%
contracting for other development shops, which means I do very little
client interaction. There are pros and cons to that, but it has worked
well for me so far.</p>

<p>Of course, the end of this little story about how I twice quit a full
time job to go do freelance development is that if at all possible, I&#8217;d
like now go on to bootstrap a small or not-so-small startup or product
company, and never do consulting again. But consulting is still the best
thing I&#8217;ve ever done for my career.</p>

<p>If that resonates with you &#8211; do
your homework, have things lined up, make sure you know what you&#8217;re
getting yourself into, and &#8230; good luck.</p>
