<p>Over the last month or so, started watching LOST. We&#8217;re up to Season 4, episode 4, which means we&#8217;ve watched approximately 57 hours of television, after work, in our spare time, in roughly a month.</p>

<p>And I say I don&#8217;t have enough time to do things.</p>

<p>Also. A smoke monster? Really? wtf LOST.</p>
