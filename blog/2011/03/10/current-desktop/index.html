<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for a nice desktop. Currently using <a href="http://mutablecode.com/apps/nerdtool">NerdTool</a> (thanks, <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/">drdrang</a> and <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a>) and <a href="http://wallsaverapp.com/">WallSaver</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Forgot to detail, just for the sake of completeness, the items in the menubar. From left to right, we have:</p>

<p><a href="http://peepcode.com/products/peepopen">PeepOpen</a>: Great plugin for TextMate, MacVim, Emacs, Aquamacs, Coda or XCode for finding files. It&#8217;s really good. One of my favorite features is that it automatically orders by the date you late modified something; so if you look in a rails app for a file named index (of which you probably have dozens), the first one listed will be the last one you edited, which is often exactly the one I want.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>: Files, online. Wait, am I supposed to say &#8220;in the cloud&#8221; now? Anyway. The truth is out there.</p>

<p><a href="http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_mac.html">Google Calendar/Mail Notifiers</a>: If you want to be notified of that sort of thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>: Instead of Spotlight. It has a few extra features (empty your trash bin with a few keystrokes), I find I like it a lot.</p>

<p><a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>: I&#8217;m still not sold on this app, but I&#8217;m giving it a try.</p>

<p><a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/">Flux</a>: You&#8217;ll just have to read the description on the site&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://littleipsum.com/">Littleipsum</a>: Lorem ipsum text generator. I wish the UI was better, but it&#8217;s ok.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a>: Keeps your mac awake, of course. Nice for presentations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/">MenuMeters</a>: So you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to keep activity monitor open all the time. I mean, you will anyways, but you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to.</p>

<p>The rest are just standard Mac OS stuff: Spaces, Displays, TimeMachine(not used, using <a href="http://www.crashplan.com/">Crashplan</a>), Bluetooth, WiFi, Sound, Keyboard-switcher (for when I switch back to Dvorak&#8230; eventually), Battery, Date, Spotlight, phew.</p>
