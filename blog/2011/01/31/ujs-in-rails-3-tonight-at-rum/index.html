<p>UJS in Rails 3, tonight at RUM</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be speaking tonight on UJS and Rails 3 at <a href="http://ruby.mn/">RUM</a>. Slides will be posted somewhere later this week, and I may follow up with a post that summarizes the content, if the slides don&#8217;t seem complete enough to cover the topic on their own.</p>
