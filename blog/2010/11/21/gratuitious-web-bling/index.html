<h3>or, <em>Just Because We Can Doesn&#8217;t Mean We Should</em></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.20thingsilearned.com/home">20 things</a> is a site setup by Google which talks about the technologies behind and within web browsers.</p>

<p>Color me impressed, absolutely. It&#8217;s a pretty website, and a nice feat of html + JS + html5 technologies to make a &#8220;book-like&#8221; experience within a web page. It works and it&#8217;s a smooth effect, not to mention content that seems to make the ideas around the web and web browsers accessible to a non-technical audience. Well done.</p>

<p>The only thing is, by the time I got to about the fourth page, I was wishing I could view it as a normal web page, and just scroll down, rather than having to &#8220;turn the page&#8221; each time. I wound up downloading the PDF version, which I will probably use to read the rest of it, as I just don&#8217;t want to deal with &#8220;reading&#8221; the virtual book any more.</p>

<p>Making a website that acts like a book is marvelous. But <em>why</em> would we want to do that?</p>

At least, provide a link to an alternate version for, you know&#8230; people who use web browsers.

<p>It strikes me as a little like trying to figure out a way to get a paper book to simulate clay or stone tablets. Maybe make the pages an inch thick and have them weigh a few pounds each. Neat if you can manage it, but <em>why</em>?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all. I don&#8217;t want to be a hater, I think the effect was executed wonderfully.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s no way I could read the whole thing in that format. If you want me to read it as a a book, publish it as one and put it on a shelf. If it&#8217;s going to be in a web page, let it act like a web page.</p>

<p>At <em>least</em>, provide a link to an alternate one-long-page-we-can-scroll-down version for, you know&#8230; people who use web browsers.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p><strong>Please Comment:</strong> I&#8217;m curious: what did you think? Did you read the whole <em>20 things</em> &#8220;book&#8221;, or stop a few pages into it? If there had been an alternate &#8216;regular web page&#8217; version of the content, would you have read that version instead?</p>
