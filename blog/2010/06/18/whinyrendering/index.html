<p>title: WhinyRendering
date: 18/06/2010</p>

<p>Quite often I&#8217;ll come into a Rails project with a good portion of the code already written. Depending on style the developers were using, this sometimes means that I may not be able to easily tell, when looking at a given view, how the view is being generated. The URL may <em>say</em> /pages/1, but for all I know, the routes file has instructions to use the ArmpitsController when it sees a route for pages/*; the URL might say /user/login, but for all we know, that may map to SessionController::sign_in. In other words, it&#8217;s not always clear.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s not even getting into the cases where there are multiple partials being used, some of which might be in app/views/shared, or who knows where.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve talked in the office a few times about a mythical plugin that could provide a little output stating exactly what controller, action, and template are being rendered, as well as any and all partials. Thus the idea for WhinyRendering was born.</p>

<p>If any of the preceding scenario sounds familiar, I hope it&#8217;s helpful.</p>
