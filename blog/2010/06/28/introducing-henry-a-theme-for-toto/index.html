<p>title: Introducing henry, a theme for Toto
date: 28/06/2010</p>

<p>As a response to no demand whatsoever, I nevertheless extracted my theme for this blog into it&#8217;s own standalone theme for <a href="http://cloudhead.io/toto">toto</a> that you could use just like <a href="http://github.com/cloudhead/dorothy">dorothy</a></p>

<p>Keeping with the Oz names, I called it <a href="http://github.com/philcrissman/henry">henry</a>.</p>

<p>Installation is pretty much identical as you would to for toto and dorothy:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
gem install toto
git clone git://github.com/philcrissman/henry.git myblog
cd myblog
heroku create myblog
git push heroku master
</code>
</pre>


<p>Now, I pretty much completely disregarded IE support when I designed the blog, so as a result I don&#8217;t think henry will look like anything much in IE. You&#8217;re on your own. I will probably eventually feel like I should update this or address it somehow, but I&#8217;m not making any guarantees as to when that would be.</p>
