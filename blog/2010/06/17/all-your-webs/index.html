<p>title: All Your Webs
date: 17/06/2010</p>

<p>Taptaptap made an extension that <a href="http://taptaptap.com/blog/speaking-of-comments/">adds comments</a> to <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, and, as you can see in the comments, sparked a little debate on whether or not this was A Good Thing.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s fine. I mean, I don&#8217;t really care if I can comment on DF or not, but if someone wants to, and if people use this and like it, great. It&#8217;s the web. You can&#8217;t control how people view your page. They could view it on any browser, with any extension, greasemonkey script, or other shenanigans inbetween, and there is absolutely nothing you or I can do about it.</p>

<p>They can <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865/">block</a> <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">your</a> <a href="http://safariadblock.com/">ads</a>. And that&#8217;s fine, because it&#8217;s their computer, and they can do that if they want to. Period.</p>

<p>They can implement their own stylesheets for your site (yes! they can!) and they will never again see the letter-spacing and line-height choices you painstakingly tested and implemented the last time you redesigned your blog. They can view your articles through <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a> or something like it.</p>

<p>It just is. That&#8217;s just how the web is set up to work. And it&#8217;s a good thing. <em>It doesn&#8217;t matter</em>.</p>
