<p>So, let&#8217;s say you have a model, and a has_many relationship to another model. You want to accept nested attributes for the child models in your forms, and you also want to validate that the children must be present; the parent model can&#8217;t be saved unless it has <em>at least one</em> of the child model associated. Easy enough, right?</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
class Parent < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :children
  
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :children, :allow_destroy => true
  
  validates_presence_of :children
end

class Child < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :parent
end
</code>
</pre>


<p>That&#8217;s not too bad. But the thing is, this will validate presence of the children on create, but not on update&#8230;</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
>> p = Parent.new # note: no children
=> #&lt;Parent id:nil ... >
>> p.save!
=> # errors glaore
>> p2 = Parent.find(:last)
=> #&lt;Parent id:23 ... >
>> p2.update_attributes("childen_attributes" => {"0" => {:_destroy => 1}, [... etc. Assume all children are sent a destroy flag here]})
=> true # what! it saved?
>> p2.valid?
=> false # what! it's saved, but not valid anymore... (because it has no children)
</code>
</pre>


<p>So, the trouble is (I think), when you save the existing Parent, at the moment validation is checked, there are still children. They won&#8217;t be deleted until .save is called. So the object is valid. Then after it&#8217;s saved, the children have been deleted, and the object is saved, but it is no longer valid. What to do?</p>

<p>Well, after some pondering, I wound up with this (in the update method):</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
class ParentsController < ApplicationController
  # other methods...
  
  def update
    @parent = Parent.find(params[:id])
    
    # assign the attributes _without trying to save_
    @parent.attributes = params[:parent]
    
    # this line winds up as true if all items are marked for deletion; otherwise, false
    reject = @parent.children.inject(true){|truthiness, n| !!(truthiness && n.marked_for_destruction?) }
    
    # check reject's truthiness first. Only try to save if reject is false. 
    # If we save first, it will save even though items will all be deleted.
    if !reject && @parent.save(params[:order_form])
      flash[:notice] = "Object updated"
      redirect_to parent_path(@parent)
    else
      flash[:notice] = "Object could not be saved"
      render :action => :edit
    end
end
</code>
</pre>


<p>Now, checking for an objects validity in the controller seems wrong to me, too, but it works. Anyone who has run into this find another way to do it?</p>
