<p>So, I&#8217;ve resisted being involved in <a href="http://foursquare.com">foursquare</a>, <a href="http://gowalla.com">gowalla</a>, yelp check-in, Facebook places, even geo-tagging twitter entries, et al.: all the &#8220;location&#8221; based check-in type services out there. There was always something I just didn&#8217;t care for about them.</p>

<p>Until recently, I&#8217;ve never really tried to say exactly <em>what</em> it is that I dislike about them. It isn&#8217;t simply the notion of saying where you are: I say where I am on twitter frequently. Am I a hypocrite? I don&#8217;t think so. But <em>why not</em>? What, you may ask, O Wise Phil Crissman, is the difference between saying where you are in a tweet, and in &#8216;checking in&#8217; with one of the afore-mentioned services?</p>

<p>What indeed.</p>

<h2>1. It can be really annoying. By frequency.</h2>


<p>Well, there is the frequency. By making it &#8220;easier&#8221; to broadcast your location, it&#8217;s not hard to see that this will increase the frequency with which a user does this. While I will probably only tweet my location at times where it is in some way, to my mind, significant, a user of the above services can easily broadcast their presence at the gas station, the library, the street corner, the adult bookstore, the bathroom, and the local dumpster. Just the fact of making it <em>easier</em> to do increases the amount of times users will do it, and therefore increases the level of <em>noise</em> in a given feed.</p>

<p><em>Why is it noise?</em> you may ask. <em>People care where I am. Besides, you already said you tweet your location sometimes. Is <strong>that</strong> noise?</em></p>

<p>If people think it&#8217;s noise, they can always unfollow me. But since I tweet my location <em>less frequently</em>, it&#8217;s also more likely to be a significant (to me, at least) location: I&#8217;m at <a href="http://www.loumalnatis.com/">Lou Malnati&#8217;s</a>. I&#8217;m at <a href="http://minnebar.org">minnebar</a>. I&#8217;m at <a href="http://cornerchurch.tv">Corner Church</a>. Whatever. The very fact that I don&#8217;t say <em>every single place I ever visit</em> makes the ones that I do mention&#8230; well, if nothing else, a better indicator of the things that I find important.</p>

<h2>2. It can be really annoying. By advertisement.</h2>


<p>There&#8217;s a good reason a lot of social media &amp; marketing types love these; because for brick and mortar businesses, they&#8217;re a marketers wet dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Every single time a person goes to a <em>WHATEVER Coffee</em> they are willing to announce it to everyone who might happen to know them? &#8230; Wow! Free word of mouth advertising!&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s even built-in <em>incentive</em> to check-in to these places (thereby advertising them) more frequently. <em>You can be the mayor. Of Snowbutts Coffee. Isn&#8217;t that great? They might even give you 50% off a biscotti, which you wouldn&#8217;t have ordered otherwise, but hey, it&#8217;s a deal, right?</em></p>

<p>The next step from this, to my mind, is a service that lets you broadcast everytime you consume a TastyBeverage Cola (&#8220;I just had a TastyBeverage Cola, shared via Consumatron3000!&#8221;). They could even automate it; put an RFID on, well, basically everything, and just have your mobile device read it.</p>

<p><em>Oh boy. I just can&#8217;t wait for that to catch on, how about you?</em> :-(</p>

<p>Now, some of you might protest. You don&#8217;t <em>mind</em> advertising for some places. You <em>love</em> your Snowbutts coffee, and you think everyone else should be constantly reminded of how great it is. Not too much, though, or you might not be mayor anymore. But regardless. It&#8217;s <em>opt in</em>, you may say, and therefore valid and legit word of mouth.</p>

<p>Sure, okay. I get that. And you can do that. I just don&#8217;t feel like giving permission for my twitter feed to become a billboard for every <em>brandname</em> outlet I walk into. You go right ahead.</p>

<h2>3. It can be really annoying. Period.</h2>


<p>I know for sure of at least two, probably more, times where I&#8217;ve seen folks rhapsodizing about location-based services, and seen the sentiment that those of us who refuse to use them just don&#8217;t &#8220;get it&#8221;.</p>

<p>Well, aside from that marginally offending my geek pride (until I stop and consider the source), I think that idea is just plain wrong. I think people who refuse to participate in 4sq, et al. &#8220;get&#8221; the idea just fine. The very fact that they &#8220;get&#8221; what these services are about is the reason they refuse to use them. (I&#8217;m just hypothesizing, here, but you&#8217;ve read this far, just humor me.)</p>

<p>Look, I&#8217;m just as susceptible as anyone else in this western consumer society to &#8220;love&#8221; a brand or a commodity. I might tweet or talk about my favorite restaurants, tv shows, movies, or coffee brand. Sure; there are things I like, things I find worthwhile enough to be a willing word-of-mouth participant in their organic marketing. I just don&#8217;t want to automate it to the point where I fill my twitter (or other) feed with these things, increasing their frequency because of the subtle (or not so subtle) psychological/material rewards of being &#8220;mayor&#8221; or getting a free doodad from WhizBangDoodad store.</p>

<h2>In conclusion</h2>


<p>Once again, Mr. Horse put it best:</p>
