<p>title: There Will Be No Newsletter
date: 03/08/2010</p>

<p>So, a few weeks ago I saw <a href="http://letter.ly">letter.ly</a> and I thought, hey, there&#8217;s an idea, so I created an account and thought to myself, <em>what could I send out a newsletter about? I know, how about time management? I have to manage my own time, I get stuff done. That&#8217;s useful, right?</em> And so I wrote a couple posts, debated on actually getting started. Yesterday I went ahead and pulled the trigger, send out the first one and also publicized it on twitter (to no real response, which is more or less as I expected).</p>

<p>I started to reconsider almost right away. While I like writing, I&#8217;m not certain I want to make a job of it. And while I like time management, and I think I&#8217;m decent at it, it doesn&#8217;t really drive me to fits of enthusiasm as a topic. I&#8217;d probably be better off taking my top few time management ideas and making blog posts out of them than I would attempting to come up with something new every single week.</p>

<p>The for-profit newsletter does seem like a good idea, but I think I&#8217;m going to stick with one channel of writing, for now. The blog has a couple ads on it, which I don&#8217;t apologize for (nor do I really care if you block ads; your prerogative), so I guess if whatever I write gets immense attention (not likely, but it&#8217;s happened a few times), some reward will trickle back.</p>

<p>Now, an e-book of some sort does seem like a better idea, and I have several ideas (one of which might well have to do with time management) that I might try to eventually work on in that direction. But a newsletter; I don&#8217;t really think I want to pour my efforts into that, right now. I think they&#8217;re better placed elsewhere.</p>

<p>So if you saw yesterday&#8217;s tweet about the experiment, and followed the link over to <a href="http://letter.ly">letter.ly</a>, yeah. That&#8217;s the backstory, and that&#8217;s why if you look for it now, you&#8217;ll see it has a message saying it&#8217;s <em>ceased</em>. (UX note: could not find a way to actually <em>delete</em> a newsletter. Seems like that would be a handy function.)</p>
