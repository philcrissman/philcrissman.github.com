<p>title: I Write Like
date: 27/07/2010</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen the <a href="http://iwl.me/">I write like</a> links show up on facebook and twitter a few times, so I decided I&#8217;d take a look. Not content to simply feed it one sample, I fed it the text from several of the posts from the archive. Here were the results:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://philcrissman.com/2009/01/14/i-hold-strong-opinions-about-the-placement-of-curly-braces">I Hold Strong Opinions About The Placement Of Curly Braces</a></li>
<li><p>=> I write like: <strong>H.P. Lovecraft</strong>. <em>Really? Wait&#8230; what?</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://philcrissman.com/2010/02/16/no-were-not-the-stupid-ones">No, We&#8217;re Not The Stupid Ones</a></p></li>
<li><a href="http://philcrissman.com/2009/01/16/in-which-i-am-no-longer-a-very-good-bachelor">In Which I Am No Longer A Very Good Bachelor</a></li>
<li><a href="http://philcrissman.com/2010/04/01/oracle-to-acquire-oracle">Oracle To Acquire Oracle</a></li>
<li><p>=> I write like: <strong>Cory Doctorow</strong>. <em>Huh. You think? Well, okay. Thanks!</em></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://philcrissman.com/2006/09/22/the-emperors-new-web">The Emperor&#8217;s New Web</a></p></li>
<li>=> I write like: <strong>Jonathan Swift</strong>. <em>[blushing] No, no&#8230; you&#8217;re too kind.</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Not sure how they are analyzing the text and reaching their conclusions, but there&#8217;s at least a <em>little</em> bit of smarts in there; that last one, the one which was compared to Swift, is indeed a satire, though I&#8217;m not going to claim it&#8217;s in the calibre of Swift&#8217;s satire, but still; their algorithm picked something out of it which prompted the comparison. Not bad.</p>

<p>So, evidently, according to their analyses, I write most often like Cory Doctorow. I&#8217;ve only read <em>Down And Out In The Magic Kingdom</em>, and several of his blog posts/essays, but enough to consider it a compliment, though I&#8217;m not certain it&#8217;s deserved. Regardless, there we have it.</p>
