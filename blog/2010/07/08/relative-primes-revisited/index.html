<p>title: Relative Primes, Revisited
date: 08/07/2010</p>

<p>As I thought; there&#8217;s always a better way to do it. <a href="http://twitter.com/jmchilton">@jmchilton</a>, who was a TA when I took Structure of Computer Programming I (or whatever it was called; the Scheme class) at the U of M, supplied this alternative solution to the relative prime problem:</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
def gcd(a, b); b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); end; def rp(a, b); gcd(a, b) == 1; end
</code>
</pre>


<p>Or, indented:</p>

<pre>
<code class="ruby">
def gcd(a, b)
  b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b)
end

def rp(a, b)
  gcd(a, b) == 1
end
</code>
</pre>


<p>In other words, it pays to know your math. <code>gcd</code> is a recursive function, basically Euclid&#8217;s algorithm for finding the greatest common denominator. <code>rp</code>, then, simply returns true if the GCD of a and b is 1; otherwise false.</p>

<p>Very nice. I wish I&#8217;d thought to do it that way, but I&#8217;ll certainly remember it.</p>
