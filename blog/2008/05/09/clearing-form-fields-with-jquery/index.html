<p>title: Clearing Form Fields With jQuery
date: 09/05/2008</p>

<p>I used a little jQuery last night to clear some form fields. The basic idea was, there were a couple text inputs in the form for first and last name; rather than label the fields, I made the value of each form to be initially &#8220;First&#8221; and &#8220;Last&#8221; respectively.</p>

<p>Then I was requested to make it so that when the field was clicked on, the word &#8220;First&#8221; or &#8220;Last&#8221; (respectively) would disappear, so that you could then proceed to enter a value without needing to highlight and delete the existing value of the text field.</p>

<p>It turns out that with jQuery, this is simple enough; let&#8217;s assume your field has the class &#8220;clearme&#8221;:</p>

<pre>
<code class="javascript" line="1">
$(document).ready(function () {
  $('.clearme').focus(function() {
    $(this).val("");
  });
});
</code>
</pre>


<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with jQuery, you know that the wrapper <code>$(document).ready()</code> simply waits until the page is finished loading, then executes the function you&#8217;ve passed to it. In this case, the function passed looks for an item of the class &#8220;clearme&#8221; and waits for that element to receive focus. When it does, it changes the value to &#8220;&#8221;.</p>

<p>Simple enough&#8230; but wait! Now if the user types in &#8220;Beauregard Charles Maurice&#8221; as a first name, if he inadvertently clicks on the text box again, his name will disappear. <em>He would need to type that all over again.</em> What can be done?</p>

<p>There may be multiple ways; but jQuery has a handy method called &#8220;one&#8221; which will execute an event <em>one time only</em>, which sounds like just what we want. So we&#8217;d change the body of that inner function to look like:</p>

<pre>
<code class="javascript" line="1">
$('.clearme').one("focus", function() {
  $(this).val("");
});
</code>
</pre>
