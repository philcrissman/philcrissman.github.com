	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/images/posts/45lb_plate.jpg" title="45 lbs" alt="45 lbs" /></p>

<p>Some time ago, if you had told me that overcoming my mind would be a big factor in working out a the gym, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have agreed. Oh, I may have <em>assented</em>, but, you know; really? My mind? Other than just getting myself out of bed and <em>into</em> the gym, I wouldn&#8217;t have seen how it mattered.</p>

<p>I realized the other day how much it does matter.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m doing a fairly straightforward workout regimen at the moment; for most exercises, I simply add 5 lbs each session (until stalling, of course, at which point I&#8217;ll stick to that weight until I can meet my target reps). This morning, adding 5 lbs to my bench press lift meant going to 135 lbs.</p>

<p>About 5 days ago, I benched with 130 lbs, and did all my sets to all my reps. So, what: 5 extra pounds? Doesn&#8217;t seem like a big deal.</p>

<p>Except that, when you move to 135 lbs on a barbell, you move to putting one single 45 lb plate on each side (the bar itself is 45 lbs). For some reason, when there were several smaller plates on each side, my mind could look at the barbell and think, <em>sure. I can lift that.</em></p>

<p>But with one, large, 45 lb plate (the largest plate you find in any barbell system), my brain thought: <em>2 45lb plates, plus the barbell? That looks heavy. I don&#8217;t know if I can lift that. In fact, I bet I can&#8217;t.</em></p>

<p>Mind.</p>

<p>I had to literally ignore the plates, and just look at the bit of barbell above my head and tell myself, this is just 5lbs more than I lifted a few days ago. A few days ago, I had no trouble. This will be no trouble, either.</p>

<p>5 sets later, all reps complete, it was actually no trouble at all.</p>

<p>Now, you may be thinking that 135lbs isn&#8217;t a very heavy bench. You may be right. Except that I haven&#8217;t been working out, seriously, for all that long, and bench has not traditionally been an exercise I&#8217;ve been strong in. As far as I was concerned, the barbell with a 45 lb plate on each side was a milestone. I may have lifted it before, but not for several sets, each set meeting my target reps. So it isn&#8217;t about how much I can bench at this point, but that my mind, for <em>no rational reason other than the large plates <strong>looked</strong> heavier</em>, was trying to tell me I couldn&#8217;t lift it.</p>

<p>Point being not how much my bench press is or isn&#8217;t. I finally see how big a part your brain plays, even in pursuits that you might normally think of as 100% physical. I can see how this could apply to a lot of things. Can I bike for 10 miles? Sure, I can do that. How about 20? Sure. 30? 50? 100? Now, if I were to try to go straight from biking 10 miles to 100, nope: probably not. My brain will balk and truthfully, my brain might be correct. But if I were I work my way up to that&#8230; If I could bike 30 miles, could I do 50? If I could do 50, how about 75? I think you still need to proceed in reasonable steps. Partly because yeah, you actually <em>do</em> need to work your body up to these things. I couldn&#8217;t come back next week and bench 300lbs just by thinking &#8220;I can do it!&#8221; But also to give yourself ammunition to overcome your brain&#8217;s objections, so that when you think you can&#8217;t, you can reasonably argue with yourself that you can.</p>

<p>There are going to be times when the truth is, you <em>can</em> do [whatever], but you&#8217;re brain is telling you that you <em>can&#8217;t</em>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s when you need to ignore your brain.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/2012/10/16/punk-rock/">Punk Rock</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="/images/posts/usedtobepunkrock.jpg" title="I used to be punk rock" alt="I used to be punk rock" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I ever was punk rock. On the other hand, I&#8217;m not sure I ever stopped.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s complicated. It probably depends who you ask.</p>

<p>For me, the entire idea of punk rock isn&#8217;t about the aesthetic, though there was a time when I sort of &#8220;fit&#8221; that mold (viz, &#8220;We all wear a uniform&#8221;, Frank Zappa). It isn&#8217;t about the politics. It isn&#8217;t even (completely) about the music, as I <em>love</em> a lot of music that the original punk rock movement sort of rose up as a reaction against (John Lydon/Johnny Rotten was infamously reported to be discovered by Malcolm McLaren wearing a homemade <em>I hate Pink Floyd</em> t-shirt), though I do love a lot of punk rock music. What I really love about punk rock music is the backbone of integrity that it aspires to&mdash;at least, in my mind. A lot of people, among them folks who are &#8220;really&#8221; punk rock, might not see it the same way.</p>

<p>I think of it as distilling the entire notion of why I do what I do; why you do what you do, why anyone does what they do. In my mind, the motivation implicit in a &#8220;punk rock&#8221; mentality is that, I&#8217;m really not doing this for you. If you like it, that&#8217;s great, and we can have this bond over this shared like of this thing that we&#8217;re doing, but I didn&#8217;t do it so you would like it. That oversimplifies, because sure, if you&#8217;re producing things, whomever you see as &#8220;your people&#8221;, yes, <em>of course</em> you hope that they like it. At least, I do. But at the same time, if you let other people&#8217;s opinions be the sole barometer of the value of your work, I think you wind up with some blank, insipid creation that takes no risks and says nothing, and yeah, no one will like it anyways. Better to do something that at least <em>you</em> like, and then if only a handful of other people like it, at least it&#8217;s genuine.</p>

<p>This makes me think of the whole idea of &#8220;selling out&#8221;. Talking about this is a sure-fire way to stir people up. For some folks, simply &#8220;being successful&#8221; is synonymous with &#8220;selling out&#8221;, which I think is (rightfully) seen as a pretty silly stance by most people. In my mind, it has more to do with <em>what were you willing to change in order to be successful</em>? Is this dumb, old fashioned? Don&#8217;t we want success, at any cost? I don&#8217;t know, but I think most people would say &#8220;no&#8221;.</p>

<p>At the other extreme, I think some people think that there is no such thing as &#8220;selling out&#8221;: no one should ever have their success criticized or impinged with accusations of lost integrity or compromised principles. It&#8217;s none of our business, some would say. I can see that, in most cases, but I don&#8217;t totally buy that, either. I&#8217;m not going to bring up examples, because I don&#8217;t want to derail the discussion into a debate or who really <em>did</em> or <em>did not</em> &#8220;sell out&#8221;&mdash;but I can certainly think of bands who I stopped listening to, not because they became popular, but because the things they changed about their music on the way to becoming popular so completely altered their music as to make them into a completely different band; not the same band I had originally loved. It&#8217;s not really just about &#8220;bands&#8221;, though; anything can have integrity, and anything that has integrity can also lose it.</p>

<p>The idea of punk rock as an analogy to <em>integrity</em> might not be a usual association for most people, but it&#8217;s incredibly valid to me. To me, the whole emotional impact of the phrase &#8220;I used to be punk rock&#8221; isn&#8217;t &#8220;I used to have a mohawk and a safety pin in my ear, but now I don&#8217;t&#8221;&mdash;it more says, &#8220;I used to have integrity, but now I don&#8217;t&#8221;. I realize this is a somewhat revisionist interpretation of &#8220;punk rock&#8221;. One could just as easily say that &#8220;punk rock&#8221; ought to be associated with ideas of nihilism, anarchy, apathy, or rebellion. But ultimately, those aren&#8217;t the things that I associate with &#8216;being punk rock&#8217;.</p>

<p>Whatever.</p>

<p>I think I mentioned already that I&#8217;ve been rereading Cerebus comics. The first time I read them, I never did get my hands on &#8221;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0919359078/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=idepermin-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0919359078&amp;adid=01FA6RVVXWRQRRTR8DQV&amp;">High Society</a>&#8221; or &#8221;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0919359094/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=idepermin-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0919359094&amp;adid=1NEE9ZRHV08T9JNTKZXE&amp;">Church and State</a>&#8221;; I had read the first volume out of a library, and then started with &#8220;Jaka&#8217;s Story&#8221; through &#8220;Melmoth&#8221; and most of the &#8220;Mothers &amp; Daughters&#8221; story line. Then I fell off the bus for a bit. I&#8217;ve now caught up to about issue 226 (part way through &#8220;Rick&#8217;s Story&#8221;). So, I&#8217;m well past &#8220;re-reading&#8221; and have moved on to just &#8220;reading&#8221;. Looking forward to the conclusion (the entire run of Cerebus is 300 issues, an amazing accomplishment by a single creative team).</p>

<p>Sim&#8217;s a fantastic artist, as is his co-conspirator Gerhard, and a great story-teller, both visually and simply in prose (there&#8217;s a lot of straight prose in certain parts of Cerebus). Well worth a read.</p>
