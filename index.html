  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you want to quit your job. Welcome to the club. Membership is free,
we don&#8217;t have meetings or rules, but we also don&#8217;t give you a t-shirt or
a name-tag on a colorful lanyard. So, yeah. Pros and cons.</p>

<p>You may or may not have, or have had, a job you dislike. That&#8217;s not
really the issue. Maybe your job is great. That can sometimes make it
harder. Regardless, you want to quit; not to go get another job, but to
go off on your own and do&#8230; well, whatever it is you do.</p>

<p>So, now what? Well, the title of this post oversells a bit. I don&#8217;t have
a clue how, or even <em>if</em>, you should quit your job. I can tell you what
I did. Twice.</p>

<p>Roll back to 2008. I worked for Oracle Corporation in a support role.
The people I worked with were top notch, but I had been in tech support
for about 5 years at that point, and I was completely burnt out on
counseling people with what to do about exceeding their inbox quota. I
wanted to move into development, something I was going to school for and
would play around with in my spare time. I had developed small
Coldfusion and PHP apps, and some academic apps with Java, and wayyyyy
back in high school (that would be, in the late 80s) some BASIC and
Pascal. I was just starting to learn Ruby on Rails, but at that point
&#8220;learning&#8221; meant only, scaffolding and mucking about with a very basic
app. I was toying with the idea of quitting and going into freelance
web-development. With a little bit of networking, I had wound up with 2
possible full-time contracts right at the same time. Both would require
me to quit my job to go full-time on the contract. One was a PHP
application. The other was a Ruby on Rails job. After not very much
deliberation, I chose to go with the Ruby contract.</p>

<p>The Ruby contract was in essence an internship. My rate was very low,
but I was just learning. It wound up being a fantastic opportunity for a
new-to-rails developer; I was able to work with Jon Dahl and Luke Francl
(both of <a href="http://railspikes.com">RailSpikes</a>, among other things) on a startup called
<a href="http://tumblon.com">tumblon</a>.
I&#8217;m going to be honest; some of the code I wrote was probably awful. But
it mostly worked, and when it didn&#8217;t, I figured out why and changed it
so it did work. I also had the benefit of working on a codebase which
had already been around for 8-10 months, so when there were things that
I didn&#8217;t know how to do, I could look to see what Jon and Luke had
already done in other parts of the app. I&#8217;m pretty sure I learned better
habits by doing that than I would if I had been forced to teach myself
Rails all on my own.</p>

<h2>If at all possible, work with people who are smarter/more experienced</h2>

<p>than you, and read all their code.</p>

<p>So, that was helpful. Tumblon eventually ran low on funding, so I moved
on to work with some other local folks, like Matt Bauer (currently
founder of <a href="http://pedalbrain.com">Pedalbrain</a>) and Todd Emmel
(<a href="http://slantwiselabs.com">Slantwise Labs</a>) for the next
couple years.</p>

<p>During this time, I continued to learn a lot, frequently by doing things
wrong and needing to figure out how to do them right. I continued to
raise my rates as I learned more about what I was doing.</p>

<p>Early this year, 2011, the work at Slantwise Labs ran dry. A couple
contracts finished up, and I was left without any work for a few weeks.
At first I wasn&#8217;t concerned, but when there continued to be no new work
for a couple more weeks, I started to look a little harder. Also, we had
a newborn by this time, so the pressure was a little higher than in
times past. So, I took a full-time job.</p>

<p>The job I took was doing Ruby on Rails for a local <a href="http://ackmanndickenson.com">web development
shop</a>
&#8211; a great company with a great team, by the way. I was hoping that it
would work out; I planned to stay there for at least a year, if not two.
I figured the stability of a full-time gig, the benefits, the vacation
days, would balance out and compensate for the things I missed from
contracting.</p>

<p>It turns out I was not correct in that assumption. I really started to
miss the freedom, and marginally higher income, of contracting. After
debating internally for weeks, I finally decided I had to go back to
freelance work. I decided ahead of time to finish the project I was
working on, gave them plenty of notice, and made sure I had something
lined up for the following month.</p>

<h2>Always make sure you have something else lined up.</h2>

<p>This is the problem I made earlier this year. I had grown a little
complacent that I could always find a new project without really trying
all that hard. Actually, I was probably just lucky. In any case, going
forward, I knew I would need (and will need) to keep my eyes on when a
project or contract is going to end, and make sure that there is another
project or contract lined up soon after the current one finishes.</p>

<h2>Do the best work you can possibly do. Totally own it. If you write</h2>

<p>something that sucks, own that too. If possible, of course, fix it
yourself.</p>

<p>A huge benefit I&#8217;ve had is that I&#8217;m pretty sure anyone I&#8217;ve worked for
in the past three years, I could work for again. I&#8217;ve learned a ton, and
I continue to push myself to learn more. Realize that you don&#8217;t
necessarily need to find clients directly &#8211; I&#8217;ve done almost 100%
contracting for other development shops, which means I do very little
client interaction. There are pros and cons to that, but it has worked
well for me so far.</p>

<p>Of course, the end of this little story about how I twice quit a full
time job to go do freelance development is that if at all possible, I&#8217;d
like now go on to bootstrap a small or not-so-small startup or product
company, and never do consulting again. But consulting is still the best
thing I&#8217;ve ever done for my career.</p>

<p>If that resonates with you &#8211; do
your homework, have things lined up, make sure you know what you&#8217;re
getting yourself into, and &#8230; good luck.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The CEO of BigCorp just got the company&#8217;s web analytics report and is
trying to make sense of it. He calls in his lead developer and asks him
what the analytics report says.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing great,&#8221; says the developer. &#8220;Look at all these hits and
page views. We&#8217;re having no scaling issues. The report says everything
is going well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Happy but not satisfied, the CEO calls in his head of marketing and asks
her what the analytics report says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so good,&#8221; says the head of marketing. &#8220;We have a lot of page views,
but no one is sticking around very long or drilling deeper into the
site. We need to generate more content and revamp our web design.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little nervous now, the CEO also calls in the SEO consultant who&#8217;s
been working with the company, and asks the consultant what the
analytics report says.</p>

<p>The SEO consultant spends a few minutes reading the report. After
looking around to make sure the door is closed and no one is listening,
the SEO consultant leans forward and asks, &#8220;What would you like it to
say?&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.&#8221;
&#8211;Brian Kernighan</p></blockquote>

<p>This sounds nice, and can (maybe) be good advice in some cases. But it can&#8217;t possibly be true; in fact, it rests on a bit of a logically flawed syllogism:</p>

<ul>
<li>A: Debugging is twice as hard as writing code.</li>
<li>B: Writing code is hard.</li>
<li>C: Ergo, if you write the hardest code you possibly can, you are not smart enough to debug your own code.</li>
</ul>


<p>The problem sits in both in assumption A, and in an unspoken assumption about what it means for something to be &#8220;hard&#8221;.</p>

<p>Regarding A, there&#8217;s no backing behind this &#8220;debugging is twice as hard&#8221; assumption; it&#8217;s simply stated. Regarding the idea of relative <em>hardness</em> of a problem; the conclusion to the above syllogism assumes that there is a ceiling of &#8220;hardness&#8221; which you are capable of comprehending. If your code is at that ceiling, it argues, then debugging it will be impossible for you, because debugging it will be harder than writing it, which was the limit of how &#8220;hard&#8221; a problem you can solve. I reality, I don&#8217;t believe this to be the case; something may be &#8220;harder&#8221; than anything I&#8217;ve yet worked through, but that only means it might take me more time and more effort to understand it; not that I cannot possibly comprehend it.</p>

<p>Now, we all know that bugs can be hard to find and fix, so we tend to simply accept, even encourage, statements like this. But are they really true?</p>

<p>Think back to your Algebra, Trig, or Calculus classes; if you took these in the same sort of classes, with the same sort of textbooks, that I did, you were routinely given assignments whose answers were in the back of the book. The idea was, you would work through the problems, and then check your answer to see how you did. If you had an incorrect answer, then you would look at the steps you took to solve the equation until you found the point at which you had made a mistake.</p>

<p>This is, to my mind, completely analogous to programming. You write a piece of code to do a certain thing; then you either write a test, or you simply run it with some sample input, to ensure that it does what you think it does. If you test it thoroughly (note: this <em>is</em> actually hard, and is the reason that bugs often slip into production code), then you will either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) discover that your code successfully does what you intended, or</li>
<li>b) discover a case where your code returns an incorrect result; in other words, a bug, or a place where you made a mistake.</li>
</ul>


<p>In case b, you&#8217;ll do the same thing you used to do with your math homework; you&#8217;ll start going through it until you find the place where you made a mistake, and you&#8217;ll fix it, and (ideally), you&#8217;ll write a test that mocks this scenario, and be satisfied that this bug is squashed.</p>

<p>Debugging is indeed hard; there are several things which make it harder than just solving a math equation. For one thing, in your programs, you may not have total control over what inputs (if applicable) are sent to your function. You might intend that factorial(num) always receives an integer as its argument. What if some malevolent person calls it and sends a String? An octal value? An object? An array? Do you care? Does your function try to detect this and either raise an error or return false? Is returning false or nil <em>really</em> what you want to do in that case? What if a number is sent that is larger than MAX_INT? Does it fail silently, interpret the number as whatever your programming language sees it, raise an error&#8230; ? In comparison, you can pretty much ensure that x, whatever it may be, in your Algebra exercise, is a number. It&#8217;s probably a Real number. And you can probably find it without too much trouble.</p>

<p>Another thing that I like about this example is that it basically shows that the process of learning math is essentially the process of locating and fixing your mistakes. The instructor, the course, <em>assumes</em> that you will not always get the correct answer. That&#8217;s the whole reason there are answers in the back of the book, and that you are assigned those questions which actually have answers. The basic premise is that you will get some questions wrong, and that through the process of realizing you are wrong and going back to find where you are wrong (and fixing it), you are doing something which we call <em>learning math</em>.</p>

<p>Programming, I&#8217;d argue, works the same way. You learn to program, <em>not</em> by consistently writing correct programs, but by writing bugs. Then, once you realize you have written a bug, you locate it, attempt to understand <em>why</em> it&#8217;s a bug, why you erroneously believed that it would work, what you should do instead, and how to do that thing.</p>

<p>We call this &#8220;learning to program&#8221;.</p>

<p>If you are not smart enough to find and fix bugs, you are actually not smart enough to learn to program. The good news is, you <em>are</em> smart enough to find and fix bugs, and you are smart enough to program.</p>

<p>The logical error comes in the assumption that <em>writing the hardest/most complex/most clever code that you can</em> is the theoretical limit of your intelligence, and that, since &#8220;debugging is harder than coding&#8221;, you are not clever enough to see the bugs in your own code.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s similar to saying that if you are doing the hardest Calculus question you are currently capable (or barely capable) of doing, if you make a mistake, you are unable to find and fix that mistake, because finding the mistake is (somehow) harder than solving the problem.</p>

<p>Put that way, it seems absurd. Of course finding your mistake isn&#8217;t &#8220;harder&#8221; than solving the problem; finding the mistake is <em>part of</em> the problem. In fact, since generally every step in solving an equation or working out an integral or a derivative involves smaller steps based on things you have <em>already learned and mastered</em> (again&#8230; theoretically), you almost definitely <em>can</em>, for sure, find your error if you go through each of your steps carefully, thinking about what you are doing and why you&#8217;re doing it.</p>

<p>Sure, finding bugs is hard. That&#8217;s because if it was easy, you wouldn&#8217;t have written the bug in the first place. The bug represents that place in your algebra homework where you&#8217;d make that tiny arithmetic error, or forget to flip the sign when a number was/wasn&#8217;t negative, or where you&#8217;d mis-apply some other mathematical rule. Spotting where you made that error is simply the process of learning math.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not the same as it being <em>too hard</em> for you to accomplish. I would guess (though I can&#8217;t <em>know</em> this) that Mr. Kernighan intended his little aphorism to be taken with a rather liberal grain of salt, that it was actually a bit of the subtle humor engineers and geeks are so fond of. The fact that we&#8217;ve taken it at face value and treated it as though it were actually true is <em>our</em> fault, not Brian Kernighan&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Now, the actual quote (according to <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">wikiquote</a>) seems to be from Elements of Programming Style, and goes:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you&#8217;re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This still has that logical leap embedded in it (&#8221;<em>Everyone knows</em> that debugging is twice as hard&#8221;, etc.), but it does have a good, valid point, <em>depending on how you define &#8220;as clever as you can be&#8221;</em>. (If <em>being clever</em> is actually <em>being smart</em>, then &#8220;as clever as you can be&#8221; would be to only write code which you are capable of debugging&#8230; but I digress.)</p>

<p>What I think this really is <em>intended</em> to mean is: if you write code <em>that you do not completely understand</em>, you will (potentially) introduce bugs <em>which you are not capable of identifying or resolving</em>.</p>

<p>The key is code that <em>you don&#8217;t understand</em>. The reason you won&#8217;t be able to find the bugs is that you don&#8217;t understand what your code is doing in the first place. If that&#8217;s true, then yes, of course you have written un-debuggable software (for <em>you</em>, at least; someone who understands what you wrote can certainly find your bugs). The other side of this coin is that, if you take the time and effort to understand the code that you wrote, you <em>can</em> find the bugs. And you can remove them.</p>

<p>This is called <em>programming</em>. You&#8217;ve probably been doing it for a long time. The fact that we&#8217;re still creating and fixing bugs only means that we haven&#8217;t finished learning to do it yet.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for a nice desktop. Currently using <a href="http://mutablecode.com/apps/nerdtool">NerdTool</a> (thanks, <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/">drdrang</a> and <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a>) and <a href="http://wallsaverapp.com/">WallSaver</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Forgot to detail, just for the sake of completeness, the items in the menubar. From left to right, we have:</p>

<p><a href="http://peepcode.com/products/peepopen">PeepOpen</a>: Great plugin for TextMate, MacVim, Emacs, Aquamacs, Coda or XCode for finding files. It&#8217;s really good. One of my favorite features is that it automatically orders by the date you late modified something; so if you look in a rails app for a file named index (of which you probably have dozens), the first one listed will be the last one you edited, which is often exactly the one I want.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>: Files, online. Wait, am I supposed to say &#8220;in the cloud&#8221; now? Anyway. The truth is out there.</p>

<p><a href="http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_mac.html">Google Calendar/Mail Notifiers</a>: If you want to be notified of that sort of thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>: Instead of Spotlight. It has a few extra features (empty your trash bin with a few keystrokes), I find I like it a lot.</p>

<p><a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>: I&#8217;m still not sold on this app, but I&#8217;m giving it a try.</p>

<p><a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/">Flux</a>: You&#8217;ll just have to read the description on the site&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://littleipsum.com/">Littleipsum</a>: Lorem ipsum text generator. I wish the UI was better, but it&#8217;s ok.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a>: Keeps your mac awake, of course. Nice for presentations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/">MenuMeters</a>: So you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to keep activity monitor open all the time. I mean, you will anyways, but you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to.</p>

<p>The rest are just standard Mac OS stuff: Spaces, Displays, TimeMachine(not used, using <a href="http://www.crashplan.com/">Crashplan</a>), Bluetooth, WiFi, Sound, Keyboard-switcher (for when I switch back to Dvorak&#8230; eventually), Battery, Date, Spotlight, phew.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re like me, and live primarily online, you have countless distractions in the form of blogs, news sites, photo sites, chat applications, twitter/facebook, web comics, etc. It&#8217;s really easy to sit down at your computer, and if you&#8217;re not focused, simply call up <a href="http://thisisnthappiness.com">TIH</a> or <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">HN</a> or <a href="http://bestofwikipedia.tumblr.com">bestofwikipedia</a> and soon find the first hour of your day has been completely sucked up just <em>looking at stuff</em>.</p>

<p>Well, if you&#8217;re a contractor or freelancer, that may not be how you wanted to spend the first hour of your day. You just lost an hour of billable time; do that every day and you&#8217;re cheating yourself out of a lot of hours, especially if (guilty look) you&#8217;re prone to a similar web-surfing session after returning from lunch.</p>

<p>Something I&#8217;ve started doing, that I&#8217;ve found to be a great help in avoiding losing focus like this, is to sit down and make the <em>my very first task</em> to be writing a test for the app that I&#8217;m currently working on.</p>

<p>So, in this context, I&#8217;m not talking about &#8220;test first&#8221; in the TDD (Test Driven Development) sense, although I do practice that. I mean &#8220;test first&#8221; literally, as, <em>when my seat hits the chair, and my fingers touch the keyboard, write a test</em>.</p>

<p>This accomplishes a few different things.</p>

<li>An immediate thing to focus on. Part of the reason I get distracted by the web is that I may not have an <em>immediate</em> action to start on. Having an immediate, easy to start, first action makes a world of difference.</li>
<li>It gets me in the &#8220;work&#8221; mindset and flow. It doesn&#8217;t matter what the test is. It might be as simple as a throw-away &#8220;when I go to this page, I should see the correct page title&#8221; test &#8211; the point isn&#8217;t that this test <em>needs</em> to be written for the health of the application&#8217;s test suite; it&#8217;s simply a hack to get you into work-mode. Once I look at the code, add a test, make sure it runs, by then I&#8217;ve only spent about 2-4 minutes, but I&#8217;ve avoided getting side-tracked, and I&#8217;m already into the codebase, so it&#8217;s very natural to look at what needs to be done next, and start doing it.</li>
<li>Hey, if I choose wisely, some of this uber-simple tests I&#8217;m adding as a first action may actually be useful. If a test is <em>truly</em> trivial, you probably just want to delete it; but chances are you can find <em>something</em> simple to test that actually does need to be true in the finished app; all the better. You <em>have</em> actually improved your test suite, while simultaneously avoiding that &#8220;morning distraction&#8221; time, and getting yourself into the flow of <em>getting things done</em>.</li>
</ol>


<p>Your mileage may vary. But it&#8217;s been working for me. Adding something like the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro technique</a> to this means that I&#8217;ll still get a chance to catch up on my blogs/etc during the day, but without the trap of spending my first hour surfing mindlessly.</p>

<p>What are your &#8220;get back to work&#8221; hacks?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be speaking tonight on UJS and Rails 3 at <a href="http://ruby.mn/">RUM</a>. Slides will be posted somewhere later this week, and I may follow up with a post that summarizes the content, if the slides don&#8217;t seem complete enough to cover the topic on their own.</p>
