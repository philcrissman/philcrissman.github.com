<p>I&#8217;ve been re-reading <a href="">Cerebus the Aardvark</a> in its entirety; started at issue number 1 a few weeks ago. As I&#8217;ve gone through the issues, I&#8217;ve been reading Dave Sim&#8217;s <em>Notes from the President</em> column. In issue 168, he begins talking about <a href="http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/nftp/168.php">the issue of self-publishing comic books</a>, and I was struck by how his first column on the topic contains advice that is really germane to almost <em>anything</em> that you want to do, but that you don&#8217;t yet know how to do.</p>

<blockquote><p>When young cartoonists ask me how to self-publish, I always liken it to a golf fan going up to Lee Trevino and asking &#8216;How do I become a professional golfer?&#8217; The answer of course is a question. &#8216;Do you have a set of golf clubs?&#8217; Here, let me write that down. Buy a set of golf clubs. And then a second question &#8216;Have you ever played golf?&#8217; Okay, that&#8217;s good. Let me write that down, too. Play some golf. Do you understand? Writing and drawing comic books is like anything else. You have to apply yourself and you have to do it. Assuming I wanted to be Eric Clapton when I grow up (or at least when I&#8217;m older), it makes a great deal of sense for me to buy a guitar and take some lessons before I write and ask him how to become like him. You first have to find out if you have the aptitude for what you&#8217;re attempting to do. Now, the only way that you are going to discover that is to sit down and try to do it. The guideline I always use is A Page a Day. If you can&#8217;t comfortably do a finished comic book page (written, pencilled, inked, lettered and toned) in a single day, you are facing trouble before you get very far along. Assuming that you are going to draw a comic book every month and making allowances for the way that life intrudes despite the best of creative intentions, a page a day is mandatory if you&#8217;re going to stay on your monthly schedule. If it takes you two or three days to do a page, the best that you&#8217;re going to manage is bi-monthly and if two or three days is the best you can manage and most of the time if takes you four or five days, then you are looking at quarterly as the maximum frequency. When you consider that the average black and white comic book is going to sell two or three thousand copies and the profits from that are going to be around two or three hundred dollars, that gives you a total income of seventy-five dollars a month for all of your living expenses. Even the most widely-known and well-thought of black and whites are selling in the low ten to twelve thousand range. It is not a get-rich quick scheme. The first five years that I did Cerebus I could have made more money baby-sitting (that isn&#8217;t a joke). Five years. Think about it.</p>

<p>But, I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself.</p>

<hr />

<p>The most common mistake of the starting cartoonist who wants to self-publish is to ask questions about things that are two or three years down the line. How do I copyright my character? How do I find a printer? How do I solicit the distributors? How much should I advertise? What you are doing is asking Lee Trevino (having already established that you don&#8217;t even own a set of golf clubs) what the best airline is to travel from tournament to tournament: how much caddies get paid; what sort of wood to use on the fifth hole at whatever course.</p>

<p>Go to the bank, take out some money, and buy yourself a club.</p></blockquote>

<p>I know, it&#8217;s ostensibly about making an independent comic book. Again, I think the core of the above advice applies to almost anything you want to do.</p>
