What Couldn't You Ship?

</h1>


	<div class="entry-content"><p>I never used to listen to podcasts.</p>

<p>That ever so slight barrier to entry, the friction of having to actually subscribe to an RSS feed and take the time to plug in to iTunes or transfer things to a phone, always was just enough friction to stop me from bothering. That and the huge variety of available podcasts (even several years back, it seemed like there were innumerable podcasts out there), and <em>no idea</em> how to evaluate what I would want to listen to.</p>

<p>My friend Todd Emmel of <a href="http://slantwiselabs.com">Slantwise Labs</a>, who I was working for at the time, had started listening to a new show called &#8221;<a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to work</a>&#8221;, and asked me if I&#8217;d listened to it, or was aware of it. &#8220;Why, no,&#8221; I said. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s this new podcast that Merlin Mann is doing,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>So, I knew exactly 3 things about Merlin Mann at that point. I knew he was behind <a href="http://43folders.com">43 Folders</a>, which I had not really heard of or read until about the time he stopped publishing regularly on it; I knew he was behind <a href="http://5ives.com">5ives</a>, which I thought was awesome and which had also stopped being updated; and I knew he had something to do with <a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com">You look nice today</a>, which I had heard wonderful things about and which I had never taken the time to listen to. And which had also stopped being updated.</p>

<p>So, Todd said this &#8220;Back to work&#8221; was really good. So I took the time to overcome the minimal friction between finding a podcast and actually listening to it, and downloaded the first handful of episodes (I think there were only 3 or 4 episodes published at the time).</p>

<p>Long story short, I&#8217;ve now been a listener for the past year+, and also listen to a handful of other podcasts, mostly also <a href="http://5by5.tv">5 by 5</a> podcasts, because they&#8217;re great.</p>

<p>Just because, I recently decided to go back and re-listen to all the B2W episodes. Unlike many podcasts which may focus, at least in part, on current events, B2W&#8217;s topics are generally contextless, which lends <em>very</em> well to relistenability. So this is the first of (possibly many) reviews of historical B2W episodes.</p>

<h2><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/1">The Alligator in the Bathroom</a></h2>

<p><strong>B2W S01E01</strong></p>

<p>Running time: 1:29:28</p>

<p><em>In which the genesis and premise of the show are discussed at length, and we are promised that Merlin intends to do more than 3 episodes. Also, Florida, San Francisco, kids, Buddhism, and ADHD.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pairs well with:</strong> 32oz of black coffee and 30mg of generic Adderall.</p>

<p>Still an episode worth a listen (or re-listen), despite the &#8220;sticking our heads up each others ass and saying how nice it smells&#8221; (Merlin&#8217;s phrase). It does, I thought, help to establish the context of how and why the show began and what both Merlin and Dan hope to get out of it, the &#8220;goals&#8221; and general topics of the show.</p>

<p>A phrase that came up was something along the lines of, &#8220;trying to become good enough that the people you really admire wouldn&#8217;t mind working on something with you.&#8221; Which is something that I had really never thought of, and did make me stop and think.</p>

<p>Another sort of blindingly obvious but still helpful, for me, observation, was the simple statement that if you want to mow your lawn, you can&#8217;t go to the movies. I.E., you really can only do a limited amount of things, and in order to to the things you really want, you&#8217;re going to need to choose the things that you don&#8217;t do. Leading up to: the higher up you go, the more opportunity you have to disappoint more interesting people.</p>

<p>Related takeaway: speaking of distraction; consider that if you have time to masturbate (assuming you have time for that), or to play video games, or to pick up your zombies on Facebook, you&#8217;re not really distracted. Selah.</p>

<p><strong>Notable:</strong> The phrase, &#8220;It&#8217;s your show&#8221; makes its first appearance right here in E01, albeit without the sharp passive aggressive undertone (or overtone) which it acquires later in the shows run. Also, &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Merlin&#8221; guy shows up, though I don&#8217;t think that precise phrase is used in this episode.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://brettterpstra.com">Brett Terpstra</a> is referenced. But without the enaging, idiosyncratic pronounciation of his last name.</p>

<p>B2W E01. If you have never listened, it&#8217;s worthwhile to start right at the beginning.</p>
