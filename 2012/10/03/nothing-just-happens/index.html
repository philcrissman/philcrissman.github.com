	<div class="entry-content"><p>More from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Sim">Dave Sim</a>, this time from the <a href="http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/nftp/185.php">Note from the President in #185</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Self-publishing does not just happen. Even if I put everything that I know about self-publishing into a single volume and mailed a copy free to everyone who wrote in asking for advice, self-publishing would not just happen. One of the biggest obstacles you are going to face in trying to self-publish is your own inertia. Jeff Smith&#8217;s standard advice is to &#8216;do your homework&#8217;. By this he means that you should find out everything about publishing and distribution before you even attempt to enter the field. &#8216;Doing your homework&#8217; is very different, however, from the traditional view of that phrase, which has come to mean (in the last half of the twentieth century) send a list of thirty-five questions to an expert and then sit back and wait for a reply.</p>

<p>Understand this:</p>

<p>Not only doesn&#8217;t the world revolve around you, NOTHING revolves around you. You are a human being. Picture yourself as a planet. Your talent, your intended comic book, your story-to-be is your molten core. It is up to you to make an environment for that molten core which is conducive to growth, which will permit your talent to flourish in a hostile world. There are any number of ways to go about this. I always recommend that the story has to come first. You have to have something to say. The only way to find out if you have something to say and the determination and work ethic to see it through to its conclusion is to make a start and stick with it. I find, at this point, that most would-be self-publishers&#8217; eyes start to glaze over.</p>

<p>SNAP SNAP.</p>

<p>WAKE UP!</p></blockquote>

<p>Love this. For years before I left Full Time Employment and went freelance, I would always look at anyone who was self-employed, or a contractor, or working freelance, and be a little jealous, and I would want to ask them <em>how do you do that?</em>, by which I really meant, <em>how can I do that?</em> Invariably, I wasn&#8217;t happy with the answer(s) I recieved. I always felt like there was some sort of magic dust that I was missing which would help me to suddenly &#8220;go freelance&#8221;.</p>

<p>What the &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; actually turned out to be was to just <em>quit</em> a full time IT role at Oracle in exchange for a 3-month contract at a pretty low freelancing rate, because honestly, I really had no idea what I was doing at that point.</p>

<p><em>3 months?</em></p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p><em>But what did you plan to do after 3 months?</em></p>

<p>I had no idea. It turned out that the initial 3 months turned into 6 months, after which I was able to go do some work for a different local developer, and so on. In retrospect, I was incredibly fortunate. But I also would never have experienced that &#8220;good fortune&#8221; without just making a start, essentially jumping without a net. I&#8217;m still not sure how my wife dealt with the stress of my taking that leap. It&#8217;s worked out fine&emdash;better than we could have predicted, really, as I&#8217;ve been able to raise my rates substantially over the past 4+ years, and we&#8217;re now doing far better, financially, than if I had just kept my safe corporate job. My first freelancing contract was essentially a paid internship in Ruby on Rails and independent consulting and I&#8217;ll be forever grateful that I had that opportunity.</p>

<p>But there was certainly no way to predict that when I took the leap.</p>

<p>When I think about it now, it seems like one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve ever made. But prior to that, all my thinking and wishing about &#8220;going independent&#8221; was pretty much exactly what Dave Sim describes in the arena of self-publishing; I was hoping to find some nugget of knowledge, some magic step that would cause my indepence to &#8220;just happen&#8221;.</p>

<p>Nothing &#8220;just happens&#8221;.</p>

<p>Except maybe entropy.</p>
