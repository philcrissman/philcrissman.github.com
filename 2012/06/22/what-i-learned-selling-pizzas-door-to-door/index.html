<div class="entry-content"><p>In 1991 I had graduated from high school and was well on my way to being an unemployed drug addict. Well on my way, as in, I was an unemployed drug addict.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;ve ever been a drug addict, but it&#8217;s difficult to buy drugs when you&#8217;re broke. This one day there was one of those ads in the classifieds of some local paper, I can&#8217;t remember the content, but it sounded good so I went to check it out.</p>

<p>It was pretty much a pyramid scheme. Here was the deal:</p>

<p>You sold pizzas, door to door.</p>

<p>What they did was, they had a truck that had some big old pizza warmers in the back, you&#8217;d meet up with the truck every few blocks and get fresh pizzas (assuming you&#8217;d sold any). You had one of those insulated bags that holds five or six pizzas in it, and you&#8217;d go door to door trying to sell them. You can negotiate to your hearts content; sell the pizzas for whatever you want, you just need to pay $3(or something, I forget) for every pizza you no longer have at the end of the day. So, if you sold 6 pizzas for $7 each, or something, you made $4 per pizza, or &#8230; $24. Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t sound like a pyramid scheme,&#8221; you say. Wait.</p>

<p>So, when you join, you join <em>under</em> someone who&#8217;s been there over four months. They are your mentor, they get an extra commission for every pizza you sell.</p>

<p>Wait! There&#8217;s more. After <em>you</em> have been there for 4 months, you can get new people under <em>you</em>, and then you get a kickback for every pizza <em>they</em> sell.</p>

<p>Wait! There&#8217;s more. If a senior dude gets 4 people under him, and all four of those people stay on for 4 months, the company opens a new pizza store, and the dude gets to be the manager of it.</p>

<p>The whole line was, if you stick with this, you&#8217;ll not only make more than $24/day, you&#8217;ll be <em>rich</em>. Stinking crazy million-dollar rich. One of the &#8216;mentors&#8217; told me, quite seriously, that he planned to buy a hockey team when he got to the point of getting his own pizza store.</p>

<p>You were trained to lie to the customer.</p>

<p>They were little lies; but basically, they didn&#8217;t want to try to explain that, yes, we were a pizza place that sold pizzas door to door. So we told people that we were doing a promotion for a new pizza store that had opened up in the area, and to promote the store we were selling pizza door to door. It was all a line of BS, there was no &#8220;new pizza store in the neighborhood&#8221;, just a truck driving around with warm pizzas in the back.</p>

<p>So, enough about crazy business models. I only stuck with this for a few days, before I started to think that the money was not worth pounding the pavement trying to convince people to purchase pizza out of the blue. But in that time, I think I could safely say I learned a few things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>If it sounds to good to be true, it probably is.</strong> The business model was crazy. Completely insane. Take heed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People will buy things if you ask them.</strong> I was pretty introverted, and would <em>never</em> have considered myself a salesman. But after knocking on door after door after door after door, I began to realize that some people would buy a pizza if you asked them to, especially if you made it seem like a good deal and dropped the price a little, just for them. Not everyone, but some folks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You can break out of your shell.</strong> I was in a shell, big time. I&#8217;ve always been an introvert, but as late teen, I was still hopelessly quiet, socially awkward, never knowing what to say or how to carry on conversations. After two days of knocking on doors and asking every single stranger I met if they&#8217;d like to order a pizza, I began to notice that: talking became easier. You began to learn that there wasn&#8217;t a huge secret, that you just open your mouth and say things, that no one else knows what to say either, so just say something.  Seriously, at this time among my drug addict friends, my nickname was &#8220;rock&#8221;&#8230; because I never talked. I just sat there and smiled and was really good at rolling joints.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You don&#8217;t have to keep doing something you don&#8217;t want to do.</strong> I quit that &#8220;job&#8221; after 2 days because it was clearly a terrible business. At least to me. Okay, really the reason I quit was because I&#8217;d stayed out late the night before getting stoned and I wanted to sleep in. It was a long time ago, I feel much better now. Anyways, you need to be careful with this, because after quitting I probably stayed unemployed for, I don&#8217;t know, a couple years. That&#8217;s another story.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I don&#8217;t know that I learned anything else. But anyways, that&#8217;s the story of how I sold pizzas door to door for a couple days in 1991.</p>
