	<h1 class="title">The Song That Changes Everything</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>John Roderick talked in RoL E42, <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-42-your-hands-would-be-your-passport.html">Your hands would be your passport</a>, about his first time hearing the Beatles song <em>I am the walrus</em>. To paraphrase, he spoke of listening, speechless, staring at the radio, listening to &#8220;this insane music&#8221;, and how it changed everything. See around minute 7:46.</p>

<p>I had a similar experience hearing that song &#8211; I mean, it is a crazy scary song, and prior to that, I think I&#8217;d heard mostly short, happy songs from the Beatles.</p>

<p>But my only real parallel to that experience would be slightly before this, when I heard Led Zeppelin&#8217;s <em>Whole lotta love</em> for the first time.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It&#8217;s probably hard to believe, but I made it to about the age of 17 without ever hearing Led Zeppelin. I&#8217;m sure I must have heard a song or two on the radio or in the background, but I didn&#8217;t know it to be Led Zeppelin. I was raised in a pentecostal Christian household, and we didn&#8217;t listen to rock music. Well, later we kids listened to <em>Christian</em> rock music. So, at about the age of 12, I thought Amy Grant was rock music. Soon after that it was other shining examples of Christendom&#8217;s rock outreach, like Petra, Degarmo &amp; Key, Mylon LeFevre, and so forth. Eventually it was Stryper. Yes, Stryper. If you know of these bands, you probably know they weren&#8217;t great, but they did play, I suppose, what for the 80s passed as a sort of rock &#8216;n roll music.</p>

<p>It was around this time that I began to hear <em>about</em> Led Zeppelin. See, I wanted to learn to play guitar, so I would read guitar magazines, and I learned that there was this giant in the history of modern rock and metal (this was about 1989, 90 maybe) called Led Zeppelin. So I was indoctrinated that Led Zeppelin was legendary, was awesome, were <em>giants</em>, and I more or less believed it whole-hearted, and I hadn&#8217;t even heard a single song. Without even hearing the music, I had built this legend in my mind of &#8220;Led Zeppelin&#8221;, and they had this mythological place in my thinking about rock music. Again, I still hadn&#8217;t even heard a song.</p>

<p>Eventually I began to seek out more music. This was the late 80s, remember. I had this habit of taking a blank cassette tape and listening to the radio and hitting <em>record</em> if I&#8217;d hear a song that I thought I&#8217;d like. Remember, again, the <em>only music I knew</em> was this 80s Christian rock. That&#8217;s about it. Overproduced (if not just badly produced), cheesy, not-necessarily-great-song-writing, derivative, bad. That&#8217;s all I really knew.</p>

<p>So this one night, Led Zeppelin comes on the radio. Not just any song, but <em>Whole Lotta Love</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if I can properly communicate the impact of that song at that point in my life. The syncopation, the raw space and rhythm in that opening, was so alien to me, I was almost unable to process it as &#8220;music&#8221;. Plant&#8217;s shrieking was nothing short of scary. The rhythm of the opening and main guitar riff was so spare, so odd (I&#8217;d never heard <em>anything</em> remotely like it), I can remember not even knowing what to think. I imagine I was open-mouthed, shocked, alarmed, and in a little bit of awe and possibly confusion &#8211; this is <em>it</em>? <em>This</em> is Led Zeppelin? This is that legendary band? It sounded like the guitar was being hit with something, or wrung though a rolling pin (I don&#8217;t know if I knew then that Page was using a violin bow for some of that, probably not).</p>

<p>Then the guitar solo came in.</p>

<p>I mean the lick starting right after all the noise and weird sounds and Robert Plant moaning and screaming comes to that that crescendo, and there&#8217;s that sharp stop to two hard beats from John Bonham. (Right around the 3 minute mark, in the youtube video above) Then that series of licks, short bursts of notes in between the drum beats and over that steady high-hat tapping. Still one of my favorite guitar solos of all time.</p>

<p>I think I had to hear the song several more times before the whole thing really grew on me. But John Roderick, in relating his first time hearing <em>I am the walrus</em> reminded me of this. Every once in a while, you&#8217;ll hear something that utterly shatters your preconceptions of what music is allowed to do (years later, Fugazi&#8217;s <em>Repeater</em> was another one like that &#8211; yes, years later, I didn&#8217;t get into Fugazi until years after everyone else, so sue me).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure everyone has had that experience. I mean, I think a lot of people have, maybe most people. But at the same time, I expect there are a lot of people whom, if you were to ask &#8220;What was that song which, the first time you heard it, changed everything?&#8221; &#8211; that there are a lot of people who just wouldn&#8217;t have an answer for that. Maybe music isn&#8217;t their thing, or they just don&#8217;t care that much, or maybe they&#8217;ve just forgotten.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I expect many people do have that memory. If you really like music at all, you probably have that moment filed away somewhere, that first time you heard the song that changed everything.</p>

<p>Postscript: can&#8217;t resist adding one more, possibly my favorite Zeppelin track, but that&#8217;s really hard to say:</p>
