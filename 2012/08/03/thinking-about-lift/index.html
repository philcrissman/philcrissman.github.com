<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/images/posts/lift-icon.png"><img src="/images/posts/lift-icon.png" width='320' /></a></p>

<p>I have so many questions about <a href="http://lift.do">Lift</a>.</p>

<p>Starters, it&#8217;s a really nice app. It looks and acts great. It has a shiny checkbox that is large and round and easy to tap, and it has pretty graphs that look a little like graphic equalizers from mid-90s stereos with digital interfaces. I can choose a whole list &#8216;habits&#8217; which are then listed and shared, and if I check a habit for the day, then I can see all the other people who recently also did this habit. I can also give these complete strangers who have also seen fit to track their performance in consistent multivitamin consumption &#8220;props&#8221;, and can (in turn) receive &#8220;props&#8221; from them for performance of the same.</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/lift-checkbox.png"><img src="/images/posts/lift-checkbox.png" width='320' /></a> <a href="/images/posts/lift-graph.png"><img src="/images/posts/lift-graph.png" width='320' /></a></p>

<p>Then I will get a cheery email in my inbox the next day, Clarence459 has given you props for taking a multivitamin.</p>

<p>Thanks, Clarence459! It was rough, but I got it done. Now if only I can continue this arduous habit, I may be a statistical margin of error healthier when I&#8217;m eighty-four, so, I&#8217;m looking forward to that. Though, actually, the kudos are kind of nice. Who doesn&#8217;t like a pat on the back?</p>

<p>The app installation procedure fascinates me. I have questions. Lift, the iOs app, is not actually <em>in</em> the iOs app store; it&#8217;s in a sort of private Beta. But when you are invited to join the beta, you receive an email with a link to a web page, from which you can install the Lift app on your iPhone. No app store, just, magically installs the application. I didn&#8217;t even know this was possible.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s gatekeeping of the App Store is near legendary, so this really raises all sorts of questions. Is the &#8220;Lift&#8221; app Apple approved? Is there even a way to get an app approved, but not have it show up in the App store? I can only guess that the Lift team has somehow figured out a way (or asked very, very nicely) to do this. If you could simply give out links to install iOs apps, sidestepping the App store completely, I would think that developers <em>everywhere</em> would be circumventing the app store this way; so I assume(?) that it must be Apple approved. Perhaps there&#8217;s something I could search for to answer this question, but I haven&#8217;t found it yet. I&#8217;m actually a little surprised no one talks about this; maybe this is common knowledge (of <em>course</em> you can have secret beta-applications which are approved but which don&#8217;t appear in the app store), but it&#8217;s new to me. Or maybe they <em>are</em> talking about it, and I&#8217;m just not following those people.</p>

<p>There is also the assumption that everyone everywhere will be more than happy to share their personal goals, and in particular share them with everyone else who is trying to accomplish the same thing. So I&#8217;m guessing &#8220;stop looking at porn on the Internet&#8221; will <em>probably</em> not be showing up in the list of habits any time soon.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s fine, though. It&#8217;s about affirmation, about things you want to change. I think most material about goals and habits would suggest that these things should ideally be positive and specific; not &#8220;Stop procrastinating&#8221; or &#8220;blog more&#8221;, but rather; &#8220;Work n hours&#8221;, &#8220;Write 1 blog post&#8221;, etc.</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/lift-list.png"><img src="/images/posts/lift-list.png" width="320" /></a></p>

<p>This leads to another pitfall; when you first begin assembling your list of habits, you are shown the list of habits that other people have entered. It&#8217;s very easy to just start adding some habits, such as &#8220;Blog more&#8221;, because on seeing it you think, &#8220;Yeah, I actually would like to blog more. I should add this habit.&#8221; Not to get all motivational-speaker-goal-instructional, but that&#8217;s a terribly worded goal. More than what? If I have written one blog post in the last 6 months, then technically writing <em>two</em> blog posts in the next six months will be &#8220;blogging <em>more</em>&#8221;, but somehow I&#8217;m betting that&#8217;s not what we all had in mind when we checked off that habit. Once a habit is on your list, you have to take a bit of thought to remove it and replace it with a better worded habit. I mean, it isn&#8217;t hard, but there&#8217;s this thing you&#8217;d have to do and it&#8217;s really easy just not to bother.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t misunderstand me, I like the app. I think a good list of positive habits than you can track to see how you <em>really</em> do at what you think you <em>should</em> be doing is a good thing. I can see it helping me reinforce some habits. I can even see the social aspect having some influence, though I&#8217;m not totally sold yet.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to try Lift, visit <a href="http://lift.do">Lift</a>, or hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com/philcrissman">twitter</a> and I can send you an invite. Even with an invite, I think they are rolling out the Beta in waves, so you might not get an invitation right away, but theoretically you might be higher in the queue.</p>

<p>I guess now I can go check off &#8220;Blog more&#8221; in my list.</p>
